--   findings                   → audit_findings
--   findings.check_name        → audit_findings.check_key

--
-- ── The two rules underneath ──────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- **`_type` is not a name, it is a suffix apologising for one.** `path_type`,
-- `slice_type` and `view_type` all say "the kind of thing this is" in a column
-- that could just say `kind` — and `kind` is already the word on
-- `cell_dependencies`. Three spellings of one idea is two too many.
--
-- **One word per meaning: name, title, summary, note.** A `name` is what you
-- navigate by, a `title` is authored content, a `summary` is the sentence that
-- describes the thing, and a `note` is an aside. `findings.note` was never an
-- aside — it is the finding's own sentence, which is a summary. Same for
-- `slices.description`, which was a summary wearing the longer word.
-- `cell_dependencies.label` is the edge's name.
--
-- ── Two VALUE migrations, not just names ─────────────────────────────────
--
-- `paths.path_type` accepted four values where three will do: `unhappy` and
-- `alternative` are two words for the same thing, and neither says what it
-- means. Both become `variant`. Nothing is lost — `exception` already carries
-- "this went wrong", so `unhappy` was only ever a second spelling of `variant`
-- with a mood attached.
--
-- `scenarios.view_type` accepted `single | side-by-side | integrated`. The
-- client has ALREADY collapsed the last two: `viewTypeVocabulary.ts` maps both
-- to `stacked` on read and refuses to persist `stacked`. That seam existed to
-- let the data catch up, and this is the migration it was waiting for — the
-- rows move, the constraint becomes `single | stacked`, and the translation
-- module goes with them. A seam kept after its migration lands is a second
-- vocabulary that nothing forces to agree.
--
-- ── What this deliberately does NOT do ───────────────────────────────────
--
-- It does not drop `cell_dependencies.note` or `evidence.note`, though both
-- are the same `note`-versus-`summary` question the renames above answer. The
-- difference is that these two are WRITTEN here: `CellDependencyEditor.tsx`
-- writes the first, `CellEvidenceTab.tsx` reads and writes the second. A
-- column with a live editor behind it is a feature, and a vocabulary sweep
-- that deletes features has stopped being a vocabulary sweep. Same reasoning
-- that kept `slides.illustration` in `21000115000000`.
--
-- They stay as `note` rather than becoming `summary` because on those two the
-- word is honest: an edge's note and a piece of evidence's note are asides
-- beside the thing, not the thing's own sentence.
--
-- `paths.note` stays in both: a path's note genuinely IS an aside.
--
-- ── The dependent names, longhand ────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `alter table … rename` moves neither constraints, indexes, triggers nor
-- policies. `__rename_schema_objects` did that in one call and
-- `21000109000000` dropped it. Every name below was read out of a live
-- catalog after applying `portable-core.generated.sql` to a stock Postgres 17,
-- so none of them is a guess — and they are written out rather than swept,
-- for the reason `21000115000000` gave: a name moved inside dynamic SQL is a
-- name the static readers cannot see, and a retired word nothing can see is a
-- retired word nothing forbids.

-- Plural, like every other table. It was singular because it was renamed from

-- 6. The four functions whose ARGUMENT names carry a retired word
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- PostgREST sends RPC arguments by name, so an argument name is wire contract
-- and not decoration. `create or replace function` refuses to change one, so
-- each of these has to be dropped and recreated.
--
-- A drop discards the function's ACL and Postgres hands the recreated one the
-- default grant to PUBLIC. On a schema whose whole authoring posture is
-- "revoke from anon, grant to authenticated", silently widening four RPCs to
-- PUBLIC would be the worst possible way to land a rename — so the ACL is
-- captured first and replayed after, and the proof block at the end asserts
-- that anon still cannot execute them.
--
-- Scoped to four functions BY NAME. A catalog-wide sweep would also rewrite
-- `origin` inside `upsert_cell`, `add_lane` and four others, where `origin`
-- is the import-provenance column on cells and phases — a different column,
-- not renamed here, and renaming it would break the importer.

-- @recipe — policies exist only where the Supabase recipe was applied, and
-- their names are the one dependent kind the core cannot carry.

-- Policies are renamed from the CATALOG, not by literal name, and this is the
-- one place in this migration where that is forced rather than preferred.
--
-- The two supported build paths disagree about what these policies are called
-- when this file runs:
--
--   REPLAY (a real project) applies migrations in timestamp order, so the
--   policies exist by the time `21000111000000`'s sweep runs, and it renames
--   them `propositions_*` → `business_model_*`.
--
--   THE TWO HALVES (core, then shim, then recipe) run the entire core first —
--   sweep included — while no policy exists yet. The recipe then creates them
--   as `propositions_*`, and nothing ever sweeps them.
--
-- Same series, same statements, two different catalogs. A literal `alter
-- policy` can only satisfy one of them, which is exactly why `21000111000000`
-- swept rather than listing: its own header says these names "appear nowhere
-- in the source as literals". They appear in two forms instead.
--
-- So this keys on the RETIRED WORDS and renames whatever it finds. The static
-- readers lose nothing here: the words being retired are written out below in
-- plain text, so a search for `findings` or `business_model` still lands on
-- this block.
