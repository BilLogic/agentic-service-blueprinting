-- The schema says what version it is, in the database, where a target can be
-- asked. Written 2026-08-25; the version number is a band allocation.
--
-- `references/adapter-contract.md` § 2 requires that a target carry the
-- template schema "at a compatible schema_version". The value existed in the
-- IR and in blueprint-workspace.json and NOWHERE IN THE DATABASE, so the
-- compatibility clause compared a file against a file. A live target could not
-- be interrogated at all — the one thing the clause is about.
--
-- This is PORTABLE CORE, not Supabase recipe. Every backend answers the same
-- question the same way, which is the whole point of asking it: an adapter
-- that cannot say what schema it carries cannot be checked against an IR.
--
-- One row, enforced. A history table was the alternative and is a different
-- feature: "what has been applied" is what supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
-- already answers, and it answers it per-migration. This answers "what shape am
-- I", which has exactly one current value.

comment on table public.schema_version is
  'The template schema version this database carries. Exactly one row. Read by the adapter contract''s compatibility check (references/adapter-contract.md § 2); bumped by the migration that changes the shape.';
comment on column public.schema_version.version is
  'Date-stamped template schema version, e.g. 2026.07.16 — the same value an IR carries in its schema_version field.';

-- The shape as it stands before the vocabulary migrations in this band.
insert into public.schema_version (version) values ('2026.07.16');

-- SUPABASE RECIPE from here. Another host re-expresses these with its own
-- primitives: the version is world-readable and nobody but a migration writes
-- it.
