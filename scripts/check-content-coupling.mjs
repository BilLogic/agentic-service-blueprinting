/**
 * Can a deployment's CONTENT hide in shared code without spelling its name?
 *
 * `check:standalone` is a word-grep. It sweeps every file a commit would carry
 * for the handful of words that NAME the deployment this template was
 * generalised from — its repository, its bot, a sibling deployment; the list
 * is `PATTERNS` in that script — and it caught eighteen sentences nobody had
 * read in months. What it cannot see is the other half of the same leak:
 * content with the name filed off. A cell id copied out of that deployment's
 * database is thirty-two hex digits and names nothing. `Regular Tutor` is its
 * cast, not its title. `Standard Scheduling` is one of its scenarios. Each of
 * those is as unusable to an adopter as its repository name in a comment, and
 * every one of them walks straight past a grep for that name (#329).
 *
 *   node scripts/check-content-coupling.mjs   (also: npm run check:content-coupling)
 *
 * Exits 1 naming each file, line, the value, and the pattern that caught it.
 *
 * ── The subject ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EVERYTHING A COMMIT WOULD CARRY — tracked plus untracked files git would not
 * ignore, the subject `check-standalone.mjs` settled in #182 and the `commit`
 * subject of `sweep.mjs` now answers for every check that wants it. That header
 * holds the listing, the reason the untracked files are in it (#180, #181), the
 * vanished-file rule and the refusal of an empty subject; what is left to each
 * sweep is the narrowing, and the two narrow differently. This one skips the
 * BINARY payloads the word-grep skips plus `svg`, which carries no id, cast or
 * asset path; it skips FIXTURES, which the word-grep does not; and it names the
 * remaining exclusions one at a time below.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE NARROWED BY DIRECTORY, over a list of seven roots — `src/`,
 * `skills/`, `agents/`, `references/`, `evals/`, `scripts/`, `docs/` — that no
 * root-level file can match. So every root document was outside the subject:
 * `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `SETUP.md`, `INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
 * `SECURITY.md`, and `AGENTS.md`, which is the always-loaded tier — the one
 * file every session is handed without choosing. A foreign cell id, a cast
 * role and a deployment touchpoint asset appended to `AGENTS.md` and `SETUP.md`
 * passed in green while the same three lines in `references/data-model.md`
 * failed at once. `hooks/` and the changesets were outside it too. The list was
 * an escape rather than a decision, because nothing beside it said which
 * documents it dropped or why, so it is gone and the exclusions that survive
 * are named one at a time with their reasons.
 *
 * TESTS. A fixture has to be able to write down the value the code under test
 * receives, and the check's own tests have to be able to plant one. This is
 * the same rule `check-database-names.mjs` states for a dead relation: a test
 * naming instance content is a fixture, and a check that flagged its sibling's
 * evidence would be pressure to weaken one of the two. `scripts/tests/` and
 * every `*.test.*` file are out.
 *
 * `supabase/`. The seed there is 1,474 generated ids and the migrations are a
 * historical record — neither is a place anybody hides content, and the seed's
 * generator (`scripts/generate_sample_blueprint.mjs`) IS in subject, which is
 * where a planted id would have to be written by hand. `src/data/sampleBlueprint.ts`
 * is the seed's TypeScript twin and stays IN, because the id rule below passes
 * it for a reason worth asserting: the sample's ids are all in the sample's own
 * namespace, and the day one is not, something was pasted in.
 *
 * `CHANGELOG.md` stays IN, and is the one place the widening found anything:
 * a released entry quotes this file's own header, cast and all. History is not
 * rewritten, so that one site is in ALLOWED below rather than excluded — which
 * leaves the rest of the file swept, and leaves the changesets it is generated
 * FROM in subject, where a pasted value is caught before it is ever released.
 *
 * ── The patterns, and why each is bounded the way it is ────────────────────
 *
 * Each entry is a SHAPE, not a copy of a deployment's data. Enumerating one
 * adopter's scenario catalogue would be a list this template has no business
 * carrying and no way to keep current; what these four catch is the class of
 * value that can only have come from somewhere else.
 *
 * 1. AN OPAQUE ID. A UUID literal that is neither the template sample's own
 *    nor a placeholder somebody typed. Two allowances, and both are checkable
 *    rather than listed:
 *
 *      - the sample namespace, `f0000000-0000-4000-8000-…`, which is what
 *        `fid()` in `scripts/generate_sample_blueprint.mjs` mints. Every id in
 *        the sample blueprint and its seed comes out of that one function, so
 *        the prefix is a proof of origin rather than an exemption.
 *      - a hand-minted placeholder. Drop the version and variant nibbles —
 *        the `4` and the `8` a valid v4 UUID is required to carry, which say
 *        nothing about where it came from — and count what is left. A UUID a
 *        person typed is a few digits repeated (`11111111-1111-4111-8111-…`,
 *        `aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`); a UUID copied out of a
 *        database is drawn from all sixteen. Three or fewer distinct digits is
 *        the line, and the gap either side of it is enormous: the deployment's
 *        own ids run five and up.
 *
 * 2. THE CAST OF THE SERVICE THIS TEMPLATE WAS GENERALISED FROM. That
 *    deployment is a tutoring service, and `Regular Tutor` / `Lead Tutor` are
 *    its lane actors. They had reached twelve sites in shared code — nine
 *    comments, and three LIVE strings the canvas agent reads as its tool
 *    contract, where the example an adopter's model is shown is somebody
 *    else's staff. Word-bounded and case-insensitive; `tutorial` is untouched.
 *    `src/content/coverContent.test.ts` already forbids exactly this word over
 *    the cover-page object. This generalises it to the tree, the same way
 *    `check-standalone.mjs` generalised that file's other two patterns.
 *
 * 3. THAT DEPLOYMENT'S SCHEDULING VOCABULARY. `call-off`, `fill-in request`
 *    and `Standard Scheduling` are its words for a shift somebody drops, the
 *    shift somebody else picks up, and the scenario that covers both. They are
 *    scenario names, so they arrive as illustrative content — "with Standard
 *    Scheduling focused, 176 lane headers…" — and a service-blueprinting
 *    template has no use for any of them.
 *
 * 4. A DEPLOYMENT TOUCHPOINT ASSET. `/touchpoint-logos/<file>` is a path into
 *    a deployment's `public/`. Baked into shared code it ships a broken image
 *    to every adopter, and it names a vendor rather than the deployment, so
 *    nothing else would report it. The template's own fixture,
 *    `example-logo.png` (`scripts/check-seed-loads.mjs`), is the one spelling
 *    that passes — by shape, not by allowlist entry.
 *
 * ── What is NOT matched, deliberately ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Warm-Up`, `Goal Setting`, `Wrap-Up`, `Help Request`. All of them are that
 * deployment's scenario names AND ordinary English a template may legitimately
 * write. They appear here only in tests, which are out of subject, and a
 * pattern for them would fail on the first honest sentence that used one.
 *
 * `Zoom`, `Slack`, `Notion`, `Figma`, `Google Docs` — the keys of
 * `TOUCHPOINT_COLORS`. Vendor names are product vocabulary, not one
 * deployment's content, for the same reason `check-standalone.mjs` leaves them
 * alone. What is matched is the ASSET PATH, which is a deployment's file.
 *
 * `student`, `session`, `lesson`. Live generic words in a service blueprint —
 * a session is a moment on any board. Matching them would report the domain
 * this template is for.
 *
 * `Front Stage Tech`, `Customer Actions`, `Support Actions`. Standard service-
 * blueprint row names, and a documented compatibility surface here:
 * `LEGACY_NAME_TO_ROLE` in `src/lib/laneRoles.ts` resolves them for content
 * that predates `lane_role`, and `references/lane-roles.md` § Legacy name shim
 * invites a deployment to ADD its own spellings. They are this template's
 * vocabulary, not one adopter's.
 *
 * And the boundary this sweep cannot cross: a role noun that is also ordinary
 * English. `Supervisor` was one deployment's actor, quoted as "the live
 * example" in an audit-check document, and no bounded pattern separates it
 * from the word a template may honestly write. It was fixed by hand rather
 * than by pattern, and the class stays a reviewer's job — what these four
 * catch is everything that CAN be bounded.
