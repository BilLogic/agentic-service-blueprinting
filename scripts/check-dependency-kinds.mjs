/**
 * The dependency vocabulary the documents teach, against the one the database
 * enforces.
 *
 * The two `cell_dependencies.kind` values are `leads_to` and `enables` since
 * 21000114000000. Before that the docs and the column disagreed for weeks —
 * the normative reference taught words the CHECK constraint refused, and an
 * agent that trusted it wrote a call that could not land. This file is the
 * check that keeps the two from drifting again, in either direction.
 *
 * So two assertions, mirroring check-read-surface.mjs:
 *
 *   1. THE ENUM. `references/data-model.md`'s Enums section states the values;
 *      the schema's CHECK constraint states the values; they must be the same
 *      set, in both directions.
 *
 *   2. THE RETIRED SPELLING. The words the column no longer accepts —
 *      `trigger` and `needs`, see `RETIRED` — may not appear as code spans in
 *      any document an agent or a reader follows: the references, the skills,
 *      the agents, and the guides. Prose is left alone (a database trigger is
 *      a legitimate subject; "a slice needs a cell" is English), which is why
 *      the subject is the code span and not the word.
 *
 *   3. THE RETIRED SPELLING, UNQUOTED. A code span is not the only way to
 *      name a kind. "trigger-vs-needs semantics" and "Walks trigger/needs
 *      edges" both taught the retired pair for a release after 21000114000000
 *      and assertion 2 could not see either, because neither wears backticks.
 *      `BARE` is the short list of PHRASES in which the two words can only be
 *      dependency kinds, swept over `BARE_TREES` — and over their JSON and
 *      their Python too, because one of the two escapees was an eval and the
 *      other was a comment beside the code that walks the edges.
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH: `supabase/generated/portable-core.generated.sql`, not the
 * migrations directly. It is generated FROM the migrations, and CI runs
 * `npm run check:portable-core` — which regenerates and diffs it — before it
 * runs this, so the two cannot disagree without that check failing first.
 * What it buys is a single flat file instead of a replay: reading the
 * constraint out of the migrations means ordering 20-odd files and tracking
 * drop/re-add across a table rename, and a check that reimplements migration
 * replay is a check with its own bugs. The LAST definition of the constraint
 * in that file is the one a fresh database ends up with, so it is the one
 * read — `enforcedKinds` says why.

 * TWO THINGS THIS LEARNED FROM 21000114000000, both silent failures:
 *
 * 1. It insisted on exactly ONE definition and threw otherwise, on the
 *    reasoning that a redefinition should fail loudly rather than be read
 *    stale. A migration that drops and re-adds the constraint is exactly that
 *    redefinition, and it is the ordinary way to change an enum — so the rule
 *    made the normal case an error. The LAST definition wins now, because the
 *    file is generated in migration order and the last one is what a fresh
 *    database ends up with.
 *
 * 2. It matched on one line. `alter table … add constraint … check (…)`
 *    written across three lines did not match at all, so the sweep read the
 *    ORIGINAL constraint and reported agreement with a column that had since
 *    changed underneath it. Whitespace is collapsed before matching.
