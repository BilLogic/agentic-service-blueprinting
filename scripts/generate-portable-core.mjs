/**
 * Emit the portable Postgres core and the Supabase recipe from the migrations.
 *
 * The package has always claimed a partition — "this half runs on any
 * Postgres, that half is how Supabase enforces it" — and for a year the claim
 * lived in the header comment of a file nobody executed. `schema.reference.sql`
 * was hand-refreshed beside a tree that moved underneath it, which is the drift
 * surface this estate keeps paying for. So the partition is now marked in the
 * migrations, which ARE executed, and both halves are generated from the marks.
 *
 * The marks are two directives, on their own line, in migration SQL:
 *
 *   -- @recipe — why this half is Supabase's
 *   -- @core
 *
 * A file starts in the core and stays there until a `@recipe` line; `@core`
 * returns. Everything between them goes to the recipe. That is the whole
 * syntax: no per-statement annotation, no second copy of any SQL.
 *
 * Two files come out:
 *
 *   supabase/generated/portable-core.generated.sql
 *   supabase/generated/supabase-recipe.generated.sql
 *
 * The core applies to a stock `postgres:17` with no shim and no Supabase; the
 * recipe applies on top of it. CI does both on every pull request, which is
 * what makes the claim a fact rather than a sentence.
 *
 *   node scripts/generate-portable-core.mjs            # write both files
 *   node scripts/generate-portable-core.mjs --check    # regenerate and diff
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The one hard part: the recipe speaks the CURRENT vocabulary.
 *
 * The core is a replay of history, and history includes ten renames in the
 * 21000103..21000109 band. Replay the core and `public.layers` is `public.lanes`
 * by the end of it. A recipe fragment written in 20260729120000 still says
 * `layers`, and applying it after the core would fail on a table that no longer
 * exists under that name.
 *
 * So the renames the core performs are followed through into every recipe
 * fragment that predates them. The map is not hand-written — a second
 * hand-maintained artifact is the thing this script exists to delete. It is
 * read out of the core stream itself, from the two statements that do the
 * renaming:
 *
 *   alter table public.X rename to Y            identifier X → Y
 *   alter table public.T rename column A to B   identifier A → B
 *   select public.__rename_schema_objects(a, b) substring a → b, in the names
 *                                               of dependent objects only
 *
 * The third mirrors what that function does in the catalog (see
 * 21000102000000): a substring `replace()` over constraint, index, policy and
 * trigger NAMES. In a recipe fragment those names are the quoted policy names,
 * so the substitution is confined to double-quoted text — which is why
 * "layers_update_auth" becomes "lanes_update_auth" and `public.layers` becomes
 * `public.lanes`, by two different rules, exactly as the database does it.

/**
 * The renames — and the column drops — a core fragment performs, in the

 *
 * Only these four forms change anything a recipe fragment can name. A rename
 * this misses shows up as a recipe that will not apply, which is a CI failure
 * and not a silent one. A drop is the same class of change: a column-scoped
 * grant written in 21000113000000 still named `screenshots` after
 * 21000119000000 dropped it, and the recipe refused to apply on top of the
 * core it was written for.
 *
 * A table rename is global — the name is unique in the schema, so every
 * mention of it is a mention of that table. A COLUMN rename is not: a column
 * name is unique only within its table, and `note`, `description`, `status`
 * and `position` are each spelled the same way on several tables at once.
 * So a column rename carries the table it happened on, and is applied only
 * where that table is spoken of. Without the table it is a text rule with no
 * idea what it is renaming — `findings.note → summary` in 21000116000000 read
 * `grant update (name, description, note, path_type) on public.paths` and
 * emitted `(name, summary, summary, kind)`, which silently deleted the grant
 * on `paths.note` and refused every save the path panel makes.
