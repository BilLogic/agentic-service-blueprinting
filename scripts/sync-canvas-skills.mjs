/**
 * One-way sync of the canvas agent's rulebook from THIS repo's canonical
 * skills/ + references/ trees into the app's vendored copy, with a drift
 * check for CI: `--check` exits 1 when the vendored bytes differ from the
 * source instead of copying.
 *
 * The repo IS the canonical source, so the sync is purely internal — one
 * repo, one copy discipline. The app bundles the vendored copy via ?raw
 * imports and serves it through the read_reference tool; the vendored dir
 * stays flat because read_reference serves files by bare name.
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-canvas-skills.mjs           # copy source → vendored
 *   node scripts/sync-canvas-skills.mjs --check   # CI drift guard (exit 1)
 *
 * IT WALKS BOTH WAYS. The lists below name every source and where its copy
 * goes, and for a long time that was the whole comparison — source to target,
 * never target to source. A file sitting in the vendored tree with no entry
 * here was compared against nothing and reported as a match.
 *
 * That is not a tidiness problem, because two other guards are fenced ON this
 * claim: `check-standalone.mjs` and `check-content-coupling.mjs` both exclude
 * the vendored tree by name, each on the stated ground that this check holds
 * it identical to a source they already read. So the one tree both prose
 * sweeps are told to skip was the one tree nothing looked at, and a file
 * carrying a deployment's name, its cast or its cell ids could sit there
 * behind three green checks. The reverse walk below is what makes the
 * exclusion those two rely on true.
