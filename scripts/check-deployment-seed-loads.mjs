/**
 * A DEPLOYMENT's own seed loads onto THIS template's portable core, and renders.
 *
 * `check:seed-load` proves the loop closes on content this repository generated
 * itself. That is necessary and it is not the interesting question, because the
 * generator and the schema move together — a seed this repo emits can hardly
 * disagree with a core this repo emits. The interesting question is the one a
 * reconciliation ticket actually asks: is the portable core SUFFICIENT for the
 * content a real deployment holds? Only a deployment's own seed can answer it,
 * and that answer is what this check is.
 *
 *   npm run check:deployment-seed-load
 *   npm run check:deployment-seed-load -- --seed ../their-app/supabase/seed.sql
 *
 * The mechanism is deliberately the same as its sibling's, minus the last step:
 *
 *   1. supabase/portable/supabase-shim.sql        the role names + auth/storage
 *   2. supabase/portable/platform-defaults.sql    the platform's SELECT default
 *   3. supabase/generated/portable-core.generated.sql      the contract
 *   4. supabase/generated/supabase-recipe.generated.sql    the enforcement
 *   5. THE DEPLOYMENT'S SEED, in the order the deployment itself loads it
 *
 * Then the same anon reads: every table the seed inserts into comes back
 * non-empty to the key a browser holds, and the two joins the app renders — the
 * blueprint grid and the service hierarchy — return rows.
 *
 * ── Why the apply half does not stop at the first error ───────────────────
 *
 * Its sibling runs under `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`, because one broken statement in a
 * seed this repo generated is a bug to fix now. Here the failing statements ARE
 * the deliverable: a reconciliation ticket needs the whole list, grouped, not
 * the first line of it. So the seed is applied with the stop switch OFF and
 * every `psql:file:line: ERROR:` is collected, grouped by reason, and reported
 * with counts and examples.
 *
 * Knock-on failures are separated from root causes and labelled, because a seed
 * loads in dependency order: a lane whose path never inserted fails its foreign
 * key, and every cell in that lane then fails the core's row-validation trigger.
 * Reporting forty of those beside the one column that started it buries the
 * finding. Foreign-key violations and the core's own `cells: …` raises are
 * therefore listed second, under a heading that says they are downstream.
 *
 * ── Finding the deployment ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `--seed <path>` or `DEPLOYMENT_SEED=<path>` names it outright, and an
 * operator-named file is not a subject: those two branches resolve the path
 * they were handed and nothing else is consulted.
 *
 * With neither, the check names the `deployment-seed` SUBJECT and judges what
 * comes back. Which sibling checkout is a deployment of this template, and what
 * that deployment loads, are the sweep's questions — asked of the tree the
 * command was run in, not of wherever this file happens to sit, so a deployment
 * running the packaged copy of this check gets its own answer. None, or more
 * than one, and the sweep says the skip out loud and hands back `seen: false`;
 * this check then explains how to point it at a seed and exits 0. That is why
 * it is not in CI: a CI runner checks out one repository, so this check would
 * skip on every run and prove nothing. It is a local guard —
 * docs/engineering/checks.md § The database.
 *
 * ── What counts as "the seed" ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Supabase deployment states its seed in `supabase/config.toml` as an ORDERED
 * list under `[db.seed]`, and a deployment of any size uses it: one file per
 * scenario, loaded after the file that creates the service they hang off. So
 * when a `config.toml` sits beside the named seed, that list is the seed — in
 * its order, globs expanded — and the named file is only how the deployment was
 * located. With no `[db.seed]` section at all, the named file is the whole seed.
 *
 * A section that is there but DISABLED or EMPTY is neither of those, and is the
 * third case this check used to collapse into the second: a deployment that has
 * taken its seed list out of the CLI's reach on purpose. It refuses — see
 * `SEED_LIST_IS_ELSEWHERE` — and the way to run it against such a deployment is
 * to name the files, `--seed a.sql --seed b.sql` or `--seed a.sql,b.sql`, in
 * load order. Named files win over everything, including that refusal.
 *
 * An entry in that list with no file behind it stops the check rather than
 * being passed over, and the text of the files is read before a database is
 * created rather than after the whole apply. Both for the same reason: what
 * this check reports is a claim about a named set of files.
 *
 * Needs a reachable Postgres 17 and permission to create a database, exactly
 * like its sibling.
