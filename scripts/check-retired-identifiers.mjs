/**
 * Check A — retired vocabulary surviving in a database identifier.
 *
 * `alter table … rename` moves the table and the column and nothing else. The
 * index, the constraint, the policy, the trigger, the comment and every plpgsql
 * body keep the name they were created with. An instance built on this
 * template discovered that the hard way — twenty-two objects still carrying
 * retired words a day after the rename that was supposed to have moved them,
 * and nine functions referencing columns that no longer existed because the
 * sweep's `\mservice_scenarios?\M` could not match inside
 * `service_scenario_id`. Both were found by hand, weeks later.
 *
 * This package avoided both: `21000102`'s `__rename_schema_objects` reads the
 * catalogue instead of a hand-written list, and `__assert_vocabulary_gone` was
 * run by each rename. But those helpers were dropped by `21000109` — correctly,
 * they were scaffolding — so nothing has watched the schema since. A rename
 * that lands tomorrow gets no assertion at all unless it writes its own.
 *
 * WHY THIS ASKS A REAL DATABASE. Upstream's equivalent statically replays the
 * migration series in JavaScript, and its own output admits the limit: it
 * checks the FILES, and anything applied out of band is invisible to it. It
 * also cannot see through a `do` block that renames objects from the catalogue,
 * which is exactly how every rename in this package is written — a static
 * reader would report the pre-rename names and be wrong about all of them.
 *
 * CI already builds the real thing. `ci.yml` applies the generated core to a
 * stock `postgres:17`, and separately replays every migration in order into
 * `migration_replay`. Sweeping `pg_catalog` there costs one query and cannot
 * drift from what the migrations actually do.
 *
 * The word list is `scripts/retired-vocabulary.mjs` and is not restated in SQL:
 * this builds the query from it, so a new rename row is enforced the moment it
 * is written down.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-retired-identifiers.mjs            # uses PG* env vars
 *   node scripts/check-retired-identifiers.mjs --database migration_replay
 *   node scripts/check-retired-identifiers.mjs --self-test  # prove it can fail
 *
 * `--self-test` plants an object named for a retired word inside a transaction,
 * asserts the sweep reports it, and rolls back. It runs first in CI, because a
 * sweep that returns nothing looks identical whether the schema is clean or the
 * query is broken — and this query cannot be executed on a machine without
 * Postgres, so its author may never have watched it work.
 *
 * Exits 0 when the database is clean, 1 on any finding, and 1 — loudly — when
 * it cannot reach a database at all. A guard that passes when blind is not a
 * guard; that sentence is `sync-blueprint-contract.mjs`'s and it was written
 * after a check spent weeks exiting 0 without comparing anything.
 *
 * ── WORDS THAT KEEP A RETIRED SPELLING ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * This section is `CONTEXT.md`'s, word for word, until #137 moved it here. It
 * lived in the glossary because the glossary was where a person went to ask
 * why a sweep skipped a word; it lives here because this is the file that
 * skips it. `RETIRED_IDENTIFIER_EXEMPTIONS` is a few lines below, so the reason
 * and the code that acts on it are now one edit rather than two.
 *
 * Three words changed and no more, all of them deictic: the section said "the
 * map above" and "the interface→schema map above" of documents that sat on the
 * same page, and here it names them. A reference that points at nothing is the
 * one thing a verbatim move cannot keep.
 *
 * Four, and each is a fact about the language rather than a queue. A rename sweep
 * breaks all four, so they are written where the person running that sweep looks.
 *
 * **`slices.description`.** `21000108` renamed `description` to `summary` on the
 * five tables where it named a one-line précis of a thing. A slice's description
 * is not that — it is prose the author writes *about* the slice. The word was
 * right in one place and wrong in five, so five moved. `tech_description`, a link
 * type, was untouched for the same reason, and is now gone with the column that
 * held it — `21000113000000` moved that prose onto `cell_touchpoints.summary`,
 * where it is the one-line précis the word `summary` names. Because the word is
 * still live on `slices`, the
 * `description` row of the rename map enforces **no** identifier fragment at all;
 * `21000108` carries its own assertion instead.
 *
 * **`evidence.proposition_question_key`, and the label above `cells.value_props`.**
 * `propositions` became `business_model` because that word already meant a *cell's*
 * value proposition. The column is not that table: it records which of the three
 * validation questions an evidence row answers — `understand`, `value`,
 * `usability` — and those three are propositions in the ordinary sense, claims the
 * service is betting on. The rename moved the container, not the concept.
 *
 * Both enforced lists key on the **plural**, so nothing has to be exempted to keep
 * either. The identifier list always did. The copy list held the singular as well
 * until the interface→schema map had to name `cells.value_props`, which
 * abbreviates "value proposition" and nothing else: a guard that flagged that
 * label would have pushed a reader away from the name of the column they were
 * editing. `scripts/tests/retired-copy.test.mjs` asserts the split — the plural
 * still flagged on screen, the singular deliberately not — so the shorter list
 * reads as the decision it is rather than as a word someone quietly dropped.
 *
 * **`CanvasAnnotationLayer`.** A rendering layer, unrelated to the lane the
 * blueprint draws. `21000104` says so in its own header. It is a frontend
 * identifier rather than a database name or anything a reader sees, so no check
 * that reads the interface→schema map can reach it.
 *
 * **"derived layer", inside applied migrations and the changelog.** Two migration
 * filenames (`20260729120000_derived_layer.sql`,
 * `20260730090000_derived_layer_grants_hardening.sql`) and ten `--` comments
 * across five applied files keep the retired words, along with the CHANGELOG
 * entries for the releases that shipped them.
 *
 * The rule is the same in both places: **an applied or dated record keeps the
 * spelling it was written with.** Every instance of this template has already run
 * those files; rewriting them buys tidiness at the cost of making applied
 * migrations mutable, which is a precedent worth more than the tidiness. A
 * changelog entry is the same kind of object — it says what shipped, under the
 * name it shipped with.
 *
 * Everything an agent or a reader is *shown* uses the current name. That is the
 * line: the record keeps its spelling, the instruction does not.

/**
 * Identifiers allowed to keep a retired word, each with a reason and usually an
 * expiry. See `scripts/tests/retired-vocabulary.test.mjs` for the two rules that
 * keep the list honest: a permanent entry must be explained in this file's own
 * header — the "words that keep a retired spelling" section above — and an
 * entry whose subject no longer exists fails until someone deletes it.
 *
 * EMPTY, and that is an outcome to protect rather than an accident. Two rows of
 * the rename map could have needed one and do not:
 *
 *   `description` → `summary` enforces no fragment at all, because
 *   `slices.description` and the `tech_description` link type are live words
 *   rather than residue — recorded in the row itself, where the reasoning sits
 *   next to the decision, instead of here where it would read as a grudging
 *   allowance.
 *
 *   `propositions` → `business_model` keys on the plural, so
 *   `evidence.proposition_question_key` is not a case this check has to be
 *   talked out of. It is a live column and always was.
