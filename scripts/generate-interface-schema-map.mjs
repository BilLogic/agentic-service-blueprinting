/**
 * Render the generated sections of `references/interface-schema-map.md`, and
 * hold the document to its sources.
 *
 *   npm run interface-map            rewrite the generated sections
 *   npm run check:interface-map      fail if they have drifted (the CI gate)
 *
 * The map moved out of `CONTEXT.md` in #137. It went there in the first place
 * because that was the file people read to learn the vocabulary; it left
 * because a glossary that also carries ninety lines of reference is read by
 * every session that wanted one word. Under `references/` it is a disclosed
 * reference: one pointer in `AGENTS.md`, read when a session touches a panel —
 * and at a path a deployment could import, which is what `references/` means
 * here (`docs/adr/0004-reference-paths-are-a-published-interface.md`).
 *
 * TWO HALVES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS WRITTEN BY HAND. The binding table is
 * rendered from `LABEL_COLUMNS`, and the coverage line under it from the
 * `COMMENT ON` statements in `supabase/generated/portable-core.schema.sql` —
 * the dump of what the portable core builds, which is also what every bound
 * name is held against, so a label pointing at a column the catalogue does not
 * have fails here. The prose around both is hand-written, because why two words
 * differ is a decision and no catalogue holds decisions.
 *
 * The coverage line COUNTS the catalogue's comments rather than reprinting
 * them; `renderCoverage`'s own header says why, and the short version is that
 * two of them are stale in a way the markdown sweep cannot see.
 *
 * IT IS THE STATIC CATALOGUE, and that is the same trade
 * `scripts/tests/documented-value-sets.test.mjs` already takes: the dump
 * describes what the portable core BUILDS, not what any deployed database
 * holds. It needs no credential, so `--check` can be a required gate rather
 * than a job that runs when somebody remembers — and the live half is already
 * covered, because `check:identifiers` sweeps `pg_catalog` itself in the
 * Postgres job.
 *
 * Modelled on `scripts/generate-docs-index.mjs`: write by default, `--check`
 * to fail on drift.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/generate-interface-schema-map.mjs   (also: npm run interface-map)
 * CI-check: node scripts/generate-interface-schema-map.mjs --check
