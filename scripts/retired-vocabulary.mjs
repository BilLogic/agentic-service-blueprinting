/**
 * The rename map — the one list the vocabulary checks agree on, and the only
 * place the map is written down.
 *
 * It used to have a documented twin. `CONTEXT.md` carried the same table in
 * prose, this file carried it in code, and
 * `scripts/tests/retired-vocabulary.test.mjs` held the two together — two lists
 * on purpose, so that reformatting a markdown table could not break a build
 * while a drifted table could still fail one. #137 made the glossary a glossary
 * again: a document that defines terms and stops. With the prose half gone
 * there is no pair left to hold together, and this file is both halves at once
 * — the list CI acts on, and the commentary a person reads to learn why a word
 * left.
 *
 * Ported from an instance built on this template, whose renames these are —
 * and not copied: the rows differ, because `sets_off` and `cells.maturity`
 * never existed here and `description` → `summary` did.
 *
 * Read by:
 *   - `scripts/check-retired-identifiers.mjs`  (Check A — database identifiers)
 *   - `scripts/check-database-names.mjs`       (Check B — names inside strings)
 *   - `scripts/tests/retired-copy.test.mjs`    (Check C — words a person reads)
 *   - `scripts/value-set-claims.mjs`           (retired VALUES in swept markdown)
 *   - `scripts/check-instance-vocabulary.mjs`  (the instance's map, against this schema)
 *
 * Held against the SQL that ran by
 * `scripts/tests/the-map-is-what-the-sql-did.test.mjs`, which reads
 * `supabase/migrations/` and fails a row that claims a rename the series never
 * performed. Its header says what it can and cannot see.
 *
 * ── WHY EACH NAME WENT, AND WHICH ARE NOT IN THE WORD LISTS ────────────────
 *
 * The commentary below moved here from `CONTEXT.md` in #137, word for word,
 * because every paragraph of it is about THESE lists: which renames are
 * carried in the `retired` and `copy` word lists, which are deliberately
 * absent, and what enforces the absent ones instead. The reasoning about words
 * retired as IDENTIFIERS rather than as words — the four spellings a rename
 * sweep breaks and why each stands where it does — sits in the header of
 * `scripts/check-retired-identifiers.mjs`, beside the exemption list that
 * applies it. What changed on the way is the deixis and nothing else: the
 * opening sentence used to say the map was recorded in the file a person reads
 * to learn the vocabulary, and three later phrases pointed at a table or a
 * definition that sat on the same page. A reference that points at nothing is
 * the one thing a verbatim move cannot keep.
 *
 * These renames landed across `21000103`–`21000122`. They are recorded with
 * the map because a sweep that catches every occurrence of a retired word needs
 * to know which occurrences are not residue. The last block closes the lane
 * vocabulary (`21000122000000`): the tech lanes become touchpoints, `support_systems`
 * splits into `support_actions` (people) and `backstage_touchpoints` (systems),
 * `visual` becomes `storyboard` (the app's own half of that one — file names,
 * components, a data attribute — followed in #391, held by no list here),
 * `step_visual` is dropped, and the design system keeps one word for each of
 * its two markers — `badge` for a descriptive one,
 * `tag` for one of a set. The `pill`/`chip` row carries no migration because no
 * database object ever bore either word; it is a component-and-copy rename,
 * held by `scripts/tests/badge-and-tag.test.mjs` over every name under `src`.
 *
 * **These are the current names.** An `alter table … rename` moves the table and
 * the column and nothing else — the index, the constraint, the policy, the
 * trigger, the comment and every plpgsql body keep the name they were created
 * with. `21000102`'s `__rename_schema_objects` moved those from the catalogue
 * rather than from a hand-written list, and `scripts/check-retired-identifiers.mjs`
 * now checks that nothing came back.
 *
 * The reasoning, where it is worth knowing. `row` and `column` named how a lane
 * and a step happen to be *drawn* today, and the axis is a rendering fact rather
 * than a domain one. "Lifecycle" was not a level above the service — it *was* the
 * service, wearing a longer name. `enables` was left alone, because it was already
 * the plain word for what it means.
 *
 * `21000116000000` is one migration answering two complaints. **`_type` is a
 * suffix apologising for a name**: `paths.path_type`, `slices.slice_type` and
 * `scenarios.view_type` all said "the kind of thing this is" in a column that
 * could say `kind`, which `cell_dependencies` already did. And **one word per meaning** — a `name` is
 * what you navigate by, a `title` is authored content, a `summary` is the
 * sentence that describes the thing, and a `note` is an aside beside it.
 * `findings.note` was never an aside; it is the finding's own sentence.
 *
 * **`21000208000000` is the one place a `note` stopped being an aside and kept
 * the word anyway**, and it is worth saying why rather than leaving the reader
 * to notice. `21000116000000` deliberately spared `evidence.note` on the
 * argument that a source's note is an aside beside the source; measured on the
 * deployment three months later, the field beside it that was meant to carry
 * the source's own content — `evidence.excerpt`, "the quoted passage" — held
 * two values in 66 rows, one of them a summary. The aside was doing the work.
 * So `excerpt` folds into `note` and `evidence.ref` goes with it, and the
 * doctrine survives with one honest exception: on `evidence` the note IS the
 * prose, because the column that claimed to be turned out never to be. That is
 * a fold, not a licence — `findings.summary` is still a summary, and a new
 * column whose job is the thing's own sentence still gets `summary`.
 *
 * Neither pair carries a `rename column`: `excerpt` cannot be renamed onto a
 * `note` that already exists, so an `update` moves the prose and the column is
 * dropped; `ref` goes nowhere at all and the migration refuses rather than
 * destroy a locator it cannot turn into a sentence. Both words stay live
 * English — a JSON Schema `$ref`, a Supabase project ref, a React ref, and the
 * standing "no verbatim excerpts" rule the skills state — so the row enforces
 * nothing.
 *
 * **Four of those words are retired as identifiers and NOT as words**, which is
 * why their rows enforce nothing and this paragraph exists — a check that
 * deliberately ignores a word has to say so, or the next person reads the silence
 * as an oversight and closes it:
 *
 * - **`label`** — `cell_dependencies.label` became `.name`, but a form control
 *   has a label and half this tree's components take one as a prop. What was
 *   retired is the column, not the noun.
 * - **`description`** — `package.json` has one, so does every tool spec. Only
 *   `slices.description` moved, and `21000108000000` had already moved the rest.
 *   The row is `cell_dependencies.label`, `slices.description`, `slices.origin`
 *   together because one migration answered all three.
 * - **`origin`** — still the live import-provenance column on `cells`, `phases`,
 *   `scenarios`, `paths`, `lanes` and `steps`. Only `slices.origin` became
 *   `authorship`, because on a slice the question is who WROTE it, not where it
 *   came from — a person may author one outright.
 * - **`business_model`** — the singular is the retired TABLE name and the live
 *   domain term at once. `21000111000000` renamed `propositions` to it and took
 *   the singular from the noun rather than from the convention around it; this
 *   migration fixes the number without disturbing the word.
 *
 * `finding` is the same case: the bare word is the live domain term, defined
 * in `CONTEXT.md`. What `21000116000000` retired is the bare TABLE name, which
 * never said whose findings these were.

 * **`slice_items` enforces, since `21000129000000` finished the rename.** The
 * table became `slides` in `21000115000000`, which moved every dependent name a
 * catalogue holds — the four constraints, the two indexes, the trigger, the four
 * policies — and missed the one no catalogue holds: the text a function body was
 * created with. `slices_referencing` is `language sql`, so its body survived the
 * rename verbatim and still selected `from public.slice_items`; calling it
 * raised `42P01`, which took `deletion_impact` and every delete RPC that reads
 * it down with it (#171). The row therefore sat here for four migrations
 * enforcing nothing, because keying the fragment would have failed
 * `check:identifiers` on that BODY — its `function body` branch reads
 * `pg_proc.prosrc`, so it saw the defect and correctly refused to call it
 * residue. (Only that one. The static twin, `scripts/tests/portable-schema.test.mjs`,
 * stays green either way: it blanks single-quoted strings before tokenising,
 * and a dollar-quoted body full of `'…'` shifts the pairing enough to swallow
 * the region the name sits in. A body is the one place the file-reading sweep
 * cannot follow the catalogue-reading one — which is the same sentence this
 * defect is written in, one estate over.)
 *
 * `21000129000000` rewrote the body, so the fragment is in the `retired` list
 * now and the dump sweep is green on it. What the fragment caught on the way in
 * is the second copy of the same defect, one estate over:
 * `scripts/agent-harness/run.mjs` asked PostgREST for the retired relation as an
 * embed, which is Check B's subject and no compiler's — it is `slides` there
 * now. A guard flipped on is worth the finding it makes on its first run.
 *
 * **One rename in this vocabulary is not in the table**, because it never was an
 * identifier and because it ended in no word at all. `evidence`, `findings`,
 * `slices` and `slides` were the **derived layer**, then the *analysis tier*, and
 * are now four records with an owner each — the table under `CONTEXT.md`
 * § What the skills produce. Both collective nouns failed the same way, by
 * claiming something untrue of half the set:
 *
 * - *derived layer* — only `findings` is derived; a person may author a slice.
 *   And `layer` is the spelling `21000104000000` retired when `layers` became
 *   `lanes`, so the word was built on a word this template had withdrawn. It was
 *   still being shipped to agents in `skills/slice/SKILL.md`.
 * - *analysis tier* — evidence is source material and a slice is a presentation
 *   for an audience. Neither is analysis. It also collided with `tier`, which
 *   already means an access level here (`20260818002000_service_account_tier`),
 *   so one word named both what a reader may write and what they may write it
 *   to.
 *
 * Nothing in the catalogue ever moved, which is why no migration carries either
 * word. What enforces the replacement is not this vocabulary map but the write
 * surface: `scripts/tests/who-writes-what.test.mjs` holds the ownership table
 * against `WRITE_TOOL_NAMES`, so a renamed tool or an unowned new write fails
 * `npm test`. That is the check neither collective noun ever had — both were
 * adopted, both went stale, and nothing anywhere noticed.
 *
 * **THE EDGE LIST FINISHED ITS RENAME IN THREE ESTATES, AND THE ROW NOW HOLDS
 * ALL THREE.** `21000103000000` renamed the table in `2026.07`, release 1.5.0
 * renamed the domain layer above it (`BlueprintData.dependencies`,
 * `remapMergedPathDependencies`, and the prose around the arrows), and the
 * INTERCHANGE FORMAT was the estate left over: `references/ir-schema.json` went
 * on calling a path's edge array `triggers`, and every reader of an IR file
 * with it. The owner settled the word for all three at once; the wire-format
 * half is #159.
 *
 * `path.triggers` therefore sits on the `cell_triggers` row rather than on one
 * of its own: it is the same concept in a fourth spelling, not a fourth rename.
 * It enforces nothing here, and could not. The `retired` list matches
 * SUBSTRINGS of database identifiers, and a JSON member of an authored file is
 * neither an identifier the sweep reads nor a word a reader meets on screen;
 * the `copy` list would have to key on the bare word `triggers`, which is a
 * database trigger's plural in half the documents in this tree. What holds the
 * wire format instead is the thing that holds every wire format — a schema
 * version. `references/ir-schema.json` names the array `dependencies` at
 * `2026.09.09`, `scripts/validate_ir.py` refuses a file at any older stamp, and
 * `scripts/migrate_ir.py` carries an old document across; the fixtures at
 * `2026.07.16` and `2026.08.25` keep the old spelling and prove the carry.

/**
 * One row per rename, ordered as the series landed them.
 *
 * `renames` / `migrations` are the translation itself: where each retired name
 * went, and the migration that moved it. They are the whole of what the prose
 * table used to say, which is why deleting that table cost nothing.
 *
 * `renames` IS A LIST OF PAIRS AND NOT TWO LISTS SIDE BY SIDE, since #279. It
 * used to be a `was` array beside an `is` array, which reads positionally
 * because nothing else is on offer — and a positional reading cannot say what
 * a FOLD did. `21000116000000` turned both `unhappy` and `alternative` into
 * `variant`; the two arrays said `unhappy` / `alternative` on one side and
 * `exception` / `variant` on the other, so the map claimed `unhappy` became
 * `exception` — a value that already existed, meant something else, and was
 * never a destination. The instance's map says exactly that and is right
 * about its own database, whose `20260821220000` really did send `unhappy` to
 * `exception`; this row was carried across from it and the divergence came
 * with it. A fold is the commonest kind of rename, and a shape that cannot
 * express one aims the sweeps that read it in a direction the database never
 * went. Two entries may name the same `to`, and that is the fold, said out
 * loud.
 *
 * A pair's `to` may be `null`: the name was DROPPED rather than renamed.
 *
 * A pair's `because` is present exactly when no single statement in the row's
 * migrations performs it — a JSON member of an authored file, a column copied
 * into another table rather than renamed, a name dropped. It is an excuse and
 * it is held to being true: `scripts/tests/the-map-is-what-the-sql-did.test.mjs`
 * fails a `because` on a pair whose statement is right there in the migration.
 *
 * `kept` is the other half of a fold, and the half the old shape had nowhere to
 * put: a value that already existed on the same column, kept its own meaning,
 * and was never a destination. Only the path-kind row carries one, because that
 * is the row where a non-destination sitting in the `is` column was the lie.
 *
 * `retired` is what the identifier checks actually match: SUBSTRINGS, not whole
 * words. A word-boundary pattern is what let `cells_layer_step_slot_unique`
 * survive `\mlayer_id\M` upstream — `_` is a word constituent in Postgres
 * regex — and `21000104`'s header records having to write that name its own
 * pattern for the same reason. Every fragment is asserted to be a substring of
 * one of the same row's retired names, so the enforced words cannot wander from
 * the names they came from.
 *
 * `copy` is the prose spelling of the same retirement, for the guard over words
 * a person reads on screen.
 *
 * A row may enforce NOTHING — an empty `retired` and `copy` — when the retired
 * spelling is still a live word elsewhere in the schema. That is a judgement
 * recorded in the row, not an omission, and the test requires the row to say so.
 *
 * `was` and `is` are DERIVED from `renames` and kept for the four readers that
 * ask "which names left" and "which names stand" without caring which became
 * which. Deriving them is what stops the two lists drifting from the pairs, and
 * what makes `is` say `variant` once where the old shape said it twice.

    /*
      THE DESIGN SYSTEM'S OWN VOCABULARY, which had four words for two ideas.

      A **badge** describes the thing it sits on: one per thing, not drawn from
      a set, never interactive — the divider caption, a touchpoint's own face.
      A **tag** is one value out of a set, selectable or removable. "Chip" and
      "pill" were a third and fourth name for those same two ideas and are not
      names any more.

      FOUR PAIRS, NOT TWO (#279). Neither retired word maps onto one surviving
      word: a pill could be either idea and so could a chip, and which one a
      given site takes is decided by the definition above rather than by where
      the word sat in a list. Written as two pairs this row would claim `pill`
      became `badge` and `chip` became `tag`, and the deployment's own renames
      refute it — `coverContent.chip` became `commandCopy`, which is neither.
      This row has no migration, so the pairs carry no `because`: there is no
      SQL for them to be an excuse about.

      `retired` is empty and that IS the entry: no database object was ever
      called either word, so the identifier sweep has nothing to forbid, and a
      guard that cannot fire is a comment wearing a check's clothes. The copy
      list costs nothing — neither word reaches a reader today — and is what
      keeps it that way.

      Between those two lists sat the app's own vocabulary — a component, a
      prop, a constant, a variant string, a data attribute, a file name — held
      by review alone, which is how `FloatingSidebarPill`, `SliceRefocusPill`
      and `PathNotionPill` survived the touchpoint half of the rename. Since
      #158 that half is a check, whose subject is every NAME under `src` with
      comments removed; it took `pill` alone, because `coverContent.chip` was
      still a live name here and retiring it was its own change.

      #324 IS THAT CHANGE, and the check now takes both words under the name
      the instance's own copy carries — `scripts/tests/badge-and-tag.test.mjs`.
      Every spelling came from the deployment rather than being invented here:
      the cover's copy button is `CoverCommandCopy` reading `commandCopy`, the
      menubar's count is `CompareDifferencesCount`, and the ledger's markers
      split along the definition above — a `VerdictBadge` describes, a
      `FilterTag` selects.
