/**
 * Does every repository path this package's own prose names still exist?
 *
 * `skills/`, `references/`, `agents/` and `hooks/` are what an installed
 * `sb:map` / `sb:audit` / `sb:slice` / `sb:whatif` reads at runtime. When one
 * of those documents writes `` `src/styles/tokens.css` `` the agent does not
 * treat it as illustration — it opens the file, and a rename three months ago
 * turns a routing instruction into a dead end the agent has to recover from
 * mid-run. Same class as check-write-surface / check-read-surface, one level
 * out: a document asserting an interface the tree does not have.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-doc-paths.mjs
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS CHECK IS THE AUTHORITY FOR ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This check and the citation guard in `src/citations.ts` ask opposite
 * questions about the same string, and for one tree they would contradict
 * each other outright if the line were not drawn. This one REQUIRES a path
 * the document names to resolve HERE; that one FORBIDS a shared file naming a
 * path its reader does not have. A document under both rules could satisfy
 * neither.
 *
 * THE LINE IS WHICH READER THE DOCUMENT IS WRITTEN FOR, and it has not moved.
 * What moved is the subject, which used to stop short of it.
 *
 *   - A document PACKED WITH THIS PACKAGE, read out of this package's own
 *     installed tree. `skills/`, `references/`, `agents/`, `hooks/` — and
 *     their byte-for-byte copy under `src/lib/agent/skill/`, which
 *     `sync-canvas-skills.mjs` writes — plus `docs/` and the root documents.
 *     An agent that opens the vendored rulebook out of
 *     `node_modules/agentic-service-blueprinting/` finds `docs/erd.mmd`
 *     exactly where the sentence said, and finds it whether the sentence was
 *     written in `references/data-model.md` or in `docs/guide/`. This check is
 *     the authority over all of them and holds their paths true.
 *   - A SHARED FILE, read by somebody standing in their OWN repository: the
 *     rest of `src/`, and a script a deployment holds byte-identical. There
 *     the path dangles, the citation guard is the authority, and this check
 *     never looks. The two subjects do not overlap: the citation guard sweeps
 *     `src/` and the named shared scripts, and nothing here is either.
 *
 * `docs/` sat on the first side of that line and was swept by nothing. It is
 * the largest prose tree in the repository, and a dangling path planted in
 * `docs/engineering/checks.md` and in `CONTEXT.md` passed the whole suite.
 * Measured before widening: three failures under `docs/engineering/`, none
 * under `docs/guidelines/`, eleven under the rest of `docs/`, and one in
 * `README.md` — against thirty-four in `CHANGELOG.md`, which is why history is
 * the one thing the wider subject leaves out.
 *
 * The three that motivated it, all landed by ordinary refactors that never
 * looked at the prose:
 *
 *   - `src/lib/mutations/{authoringRpc,sliceMutations,findingMutations}.ts`
 *     in references/adapter-contract.md — that directory has never existed;
 *     two of the three files live flat under `src/lib/`, the third is the
 *     `findings.recordFindings` port on the backend adapters.
 *   - `src/styles/tokens.css` in references/customization.md — the styles
 *     were split into a dozen files, and the BRAND SEAM an adopter is being
 *     sent to edit moved to `src/styles/themes/light.css`.
 *   - `scripts/generate_scale_fixture.mjs` in references/data-model.md —
 *     renamed to `generate_sample_blueprint.mjs`.
 *
 * ── How a token is resolved ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Backticked tokens and relative markdown link targets that end in a source
 * or document extension. A token passes on the FIRST of:
 *
 *   1. it exists at the repository root;
 *   2. it exists relative to the document that names it;
 *   3. it is a segment-aligned SUFFIX of a tracked path. This is what lets
 *      prose name `adapters/fixture.ts` or a bare `validate_ir.py` without
 *      spelling the whole path every time — the docs do this constantly and
 *      the reader resolves it fine. A suffix that matches nothing is the
 *      failure this check is for;
 *   4. it is in WORKSPACE_ARTIFACTS below — a file an ADOPTER's workspace
 *      has and this tree never will, whatever document names it;
 *   5. it is in ABSENT_BY_DESIGN below, which exempts ONE document naming ONE
 *      token, because the reasons there are about the sentence rather than
 *      about the path.
 *
 * `*` is honoured at every step, including in WORKSPACE_ARTIFACTS — the
 * roster genuinely is a glob (`skills/audit/references/check-*.md`), and
 * `blueprint/*.json` was listed as one and matched only a document that wrote
 * the asterisk down, which left the three documents naming the real file
 * failing against an exemption written for them.
 *
 * BOTH LISTS FAIL CLOSED, the way check-read-surface's NOT_TOOLS does: a file
 * that legitimately cannot exist here is a one-line admission with a reason,
 * not a hole the next stale path slips through. And an entry in either that
 * matches nothing any more is itself a failure, for the reason every list of
 * its kind here gives — an exemption nobody can reach is a hole nobody is
 * watching.
