/**
 * Which end of an `enables` edge is the precondition — asserted, not assumed.
 *
 * `enables` replaced `depends_on` for exactly one reason, and the migration
 * that made the change said so: the problem was never the word, it was
 * DIRECTION.
 *
 *     A sets_off   B  →  A comes first, A causes B
 *     A depends_on B  →  B comes first, B is required by A
 *
 * Two kinds pointing opposite ways means an edge's direction cannot be read
 * without first checking its kind. `enables` puts both kinds source-first:
 * "Account has been verified" enables "Greets the customer by name".
 * CONTEXT.md says the same ("both read source-first"), and the panel groups
 * are symmetric because of it.
 *
 * The agent surface has said the opposite before. `create_cell_dependency`
 * described `enables` as "the target must already be true for the source to
 * work", and the canvas adapter repeated it — so an agent following either
 * wrote every precondition edge backwards, into a column whose CHECK
 * constraint is happy to store it that way. Nothing failed; the graph was just
 * wrong, and the what-if trace that walks it inherited the error.
 *
 * A prose contradiction between files is not something a type can catch, so
 * this is the mechanism. It is deliberately about DIRECTION rather than
 * wording: any of these may be rewritten, and none may say that the target
 * comes first.
 *
 * Run: npm test
