/**
 * Check F — a lane is a row of the board, and nothing else is a lane.
 *
 * A **lane** is one actor's activity across the steps: a ROW, a `lanes` row,
 * carrying a `lane_role` from a closed set. `CONTEXT.md` defines it. A
 * **layer** is anything stacked, staged, composited or tiered — the CSS
 * cascade's `@layer`, a composited paint layer, the opaque cover a boot
 * skeleton draws over a sidebar, a rung of the canvas reveal, a design-token
 * tier, an architectural tier like "the tool layer". The two words name
 * disjoint things and this repository needs both.
 *
 * `21000104` renamed the table `layers` to `lanes` and the prose was carried
 * over by word replacement, so every sentence using `layer` in one of those
 * OTHER senses came out saying `lane`. `a1bb7d4a` restored eleven of them;
 * roughly ninety more survived, in comments, in test names, in a prop typed
 * `ArrowLayer` but called `lane`, and in one paragraph a reader sees.
 *
 * WHY THE EXISTING GUARDS COULD NOT SEE THEM. Check A and Check B read
 * database identifiers, and none of these is one. Check C reads the strings a
 * reader meets, and almost none of these reaches a reader. The residue sweep
 * beside Check C catches what a replacement makes of a word it lands INSIDE —
 * `laneed`, `unlaneed` — which is a non-word, and therefore decidable. None of
 * that reaches a valid English word standing for the wrong idea, which is the
 * other half of what a rename over prose produces and the half this file is
 * for.
 *
 * ── SUBJECT: PROSE INCLUDED, WHICH INVERTS CHECK E ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `a-slide-is-not-a-screen.test.mjs` reads names with COMMENTS REMOVED, and
 * its header says why: prose may use an English word, a name may not misuse
 * one. That rule is right for `screen`, which names nothing on the slice
 * surface, and it is exactly wrong here. `lane` is this vocabulary's own word,
 * so the damage is not a name misusing English — it is prose using the domain
 * word for something that is not in the domain. Every site listed above but
 * three lives in a comment. So comments are IN the subject, and the price of
 * that is paid below: the patterns have to earn their place one at a time.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS COLLOCATION AND NOT A LIST OF SITES ────────────────────────
 *
 * Four cheaper shapes were tried against the whole tree first, and each is
 * recorded here because the next person will think of them too.
 *
 * POSITION does not separate the senses. In `blueprint.css`, 40 of the 44
 * correct uses of `lane` are in comments and so are all 9 wrong ones; line
 * 700 says "phase frames + lane structure", which is the board, and the very
 * next comment block says "each lane opens when the one before it", which is
 * the reveal. One file, one region, both senses.
 *
 * A PER-FILE SENSE DECLARATION does not work for the same reason, one level
 * up. 91 of the 189 files that use the word hold no lane identifier at all
 * and still discuss board lanes correctly in prose; and the three worst-hit
 * files — `blueprint.css`, `EditorShell.tsx`, `ServiceOverviewView.tsx` —
 * each carry both senses, `EditorShell` within a single sentence: "One layer
 * fixes both … the beat the canvas opens its phase lanes".
 *
 * THE PRE-RENAME TREE IS NOT AN ORACLE, though it is the best evidence there
 * is and it settled a dozen calls. Before the rename `layer` was BOTH words:
 * the schema's name for a row AND the stacking sense. So a pre-rename `layer`
 * may be either — `ServiceOverviewView` had 17 of them, 16 the reveal and one
 * the board's row count. Only the negative direction is sound: a pre-rename
 * `lane` was never touched by the sweep and is therefore the domain word.
 *
 * AN ALLOWLIST OF MODIFIERS is unbuildable. The words that precede `lane` in
 * this tree are overwhelmingly determiners and ordinary adjectives — "a
 * read-only lane", "an empty lane", "the leftmost lane" — so a rule requiring
 * the modifier to be board vocabulary would fail on ordinary writing.
 *
 * What is left, and what this file asserts, is the company the word keeps. A
 * lane is a row of the board: it is not painted over anything, it does not
 * stack, it is not a rung of an animation, and it is not a tier of software.
 * So `lane` may not stand in the vocabulary of the cascade, of compositing,
 * of stacking or of an architectural tier. EACH PATTERN NAMES A CONCEPT, NOT
 * A SITE. `boot lane` is forbidden because a row of the board does not boot,
 * not because twelve files said it; the thirteenth is caught the day it is
 * written, and this file has no idea how many there are.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN ────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured against the ninety-odd sentences actually repaired, these patterns
 * catch a little under half. The rest are ANAPHORA: a comment establishes
 * "the boot layer" in its first sentence and says "the lane" four sentences
 * later, or writes "each lane opens when the one before it". The referent is
 * a paragraph away and no line-local rule reaches it. Resolving that needs a
 * parser and a model of the paragraph, which is a bigger machine than the
 * defect deserves and one whose false positives would be argued about
 * forever.
 *
 * That is a real limit and it is the honest one. What makes it tolerable is
 * that anaphora does not arrive alone: a paragraph that says "the lane"
 * meaning a layer almost always NAMES the thing once, and naming it is what
 * this file catches. A sweep that mangles a paragraph trips the pattern on
 * the sentence that introduced the noun, and the reader fixing that line has
 * the rest of the paragraph in front of them.
 *
 * IDENTIFIERS NEED ONLY THEIR DECLARATION CAUGHT, which is why the name
 * patterns below are short. `lane: ArrowLayer` was one line; correcting it
 * turned all twenty-one of its uses into type errors, so `tsc` did the sweep.
 * A guard that also listed `lane === 'forward'` would be enumerating what the
 * compiler already reports.
 *
 * A QUOTED IDENTIFIER IN A COMMENT IS THE HOLE IN THAT ARGUMENT, and
 * `canvasStackingContract.test.ts` sat in it from the rename until a
 * deployment reading the same file found it. That file's header
 * recalls the assertion it used to make, quoting the ternary as a string:
 * "pin `lane === 'forward' ? ...` as an exact substring". The sweep rewrote a
 * `layer` that no compiler was ever going to read, so the paragraph above
 * does not hold — `tsc` sweeps identifiers in CODE, and prose quoting an
 * identifier has no such backstop. The comment then misquoted the very line
 * it documents, which is the worst form this defect takes: the reader who
 * checks the code against the comment finds them disagreeing and cannot tell
 * which one moved.
 *
 * A TEST TITLE IS THE SECOND SHAPE, from that same file: `contains
 * canvas-local lanes in one stacking context`. Here the layer word is right
 * there in the sentence and is even in `LAYER_SENSE` — but it sits AFTER the
 * noun, inside `stacking context`, and these patterns read the word BEFORE.
 * Reading the whole line instead would fire on true sentences: `EditorShell`
 * and `ScenarioBlueprintPanel` both describe "one lane rail" and slots
 * "stacking each path's version" in one breath, and a lane genuinely does sit
 * inside a stacking context. The collocation is real in both directions,
 * which is exactly why proximity cannot decide it.
 *
 * NEITHER WAS WIDENED FOR, deliberately. The first needs `lane === 'forward'`
 * listed, which the paragraph above argues against and the test below still
 * asserts returns nothing. The second needs a rule that reads the sentence.
 * Both are written down here instead, because a limit this section names is
 * one the next reader can work around, and a limit it hides is one they
 * rediscover the way this one was rediscovered — from downstream.
 *
 * IF THIS PRODUCES A FALSE POSITIVE, THE ANSWER IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE
 * SENTENCE, NOT A NEW EXEMPTION. A genuine board lane described with one of
 * these words is a sentence worth rereading; if it survives the reread, the
 * pattern was wrong about the concept and the pattern goes.
