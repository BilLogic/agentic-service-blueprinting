/**
 * The path sweep refuses a subject a FILTER emptied, not only one a listing
 * did.
 *
 * `trackedPaths` already refused an empty `git ls-files`, and that reads like
 * the whole guard until you follow what the loop actually sweeps: the listing
 * goes through `surfaceDocs`, and a filter that matches nothing empties the
 * subject exactly as completely as a listing that came back empty. The loop
 * runs zero times, no claim in any document is resolved, and the report says
 * `every path named by 0 packaged documents resolves` — a sentence that is
 * true, green, and about nothing. One renamed folder does it.
 *
 * And the subject the filter describes: the check was fenced to the four
 * plugin-surface folders, so `docs/` — the largest prose tree here — and the
 * root documents were resolved by nothing at all. Planted dangling paths in
 * `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/engineering/checks.md` passed the whole suite.
 *
 * Run: npm test
