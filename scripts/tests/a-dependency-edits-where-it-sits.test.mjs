/**
 * Editing a dependency where it sits: one function, and the declarations that
 * make it the same kind of write as its siblings.
 *
 * THE BEHAVIOUR IS PERFORMED IN THE MIGRATION, not here, because it needs a
 * database and a pull request's unit run has none. The migration builds a
 * fixture, changes an edge's kind and then its target through the new
 * function, and raises unless one row survives each time, the returned row is
 * the row as it stood, and feeding that row straight back puts the edge where
 * it started. CI replays it on a stock Postgres.
 *
 * What is here is the DECLARATION side: the signature, the grants, the one
 * statement that writes, and the proof's own claims. Each is shown going red
 * against a copy with the declaration cut out, because a search that found
 * nothing passes exactly as loudly as a search that agreed.
 *
 * Run: npm test
