/**
 * The rename map's word lists come from the names the map records, and every
 * exemption still says why.
 *
 * There used to be a fourth test here, holding `CONTEXT.md`'s prose table
 * against `scripts/retired-vocabulary.mjs`. Two lists were the point: a prose
 * table should not be load-bearing for a build, and a documented map that had
 * drifted from the enforced one was a lie in the file people read to learn the
 * vocabulary. #137 removed the prose half — the glossary defines terms and
 * stops — so the pair is a single list and the parity test has nothing left to
 * compare. What that test was protecting is now protected by there being one
 * map.
 *
 * The two rules that used to read the glossary read a HEADER instead, and both
 * read the header of the file that acts on them: a row enforcing nothing is
 * explained where the row is, and a permanent exemption is explained where the
 * check skips the word. Exemption and reason are one edit rather than two.
 *
 * The exemption rules live here because they are the same argument. An
 * exemption that cannot expire is how upstream's `Layer` breadcrumb survived
 * six months as a "temporary" sequencing note, and a permanent one that
 * explains itself nowhere is the same thing wearing a reason.
