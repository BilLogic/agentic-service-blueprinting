/**
 * A CORRECT SKIP IS STILL A SUBJECT NOBODY MEASURED, AND IT SAYS SO.
 *
 * Several guards here end by not looking: no database is configured, the
 * folder they sweep is not in this tree, the checkout was handed no tags. Each
 * of those skips is right, and each of them used to leave a log line among the
 * other log lines and a green exit — the same two things a run that measured
 * everything leaves. `unverified` is the one register that separates them, and
 * this drives it rather than describing it.
 *
 * The sinks are seams, so the annotation and the summary line are asserted as
 * text instead of being inferred from a runner nothing here can start.
 *
 * Run: npm test
