/**
 * Who owns each record about the board — checked against the write surface.
 *
 * `evidence`, `findings`, `slices` and `slides` have had two collective nouns
 * and lost both, because no one word was true of all four. What replaced the
 * noun is an OWNER per record, and that claim is not a preference: a table's
 * owner is whoever may CHANGE it, and the set of things that may change it is
 * `WRITE_TOOL_NAMES` — read here through `check-write-surface.mjs`'s own
 * `declaredWriteTools` rather than a second parser of the same file.
 *
 * Three rules:
 *
 *   1. every tool the table credits is on the write roster — a renamed or
 *      deleted tool fails here rather than leaving CONTEXT.md quietly wrong
 *   2. every write tool that NAMES one of these records is assigned an owner —
 *      a `delete_slice` nobody added to the table fails here
 *   3. CONTEXT.md's own table PARSES to the rows below — not "the file
 *      mentions these words somewhere", which `findings` and `slices` would
 *      satisfy from a dozen other paragraphs, but the three rows themselves
 *
 * The SUBJECT of rule 2 is the tool NAME, deliberately: a tool called
 * `refresh_board` that happened to write `slices` would pass. The name is what
 * a reader of the roster has, what a table actually writes is
 * `check:write-surface`'s subject, and reimplementing that scan here would be a
 * second reader to drift from the first.
 *
 * `evidence` claims NO tools, and rule 2 is what makes that row load-bearing
 * instead of decorative: nothing on the roster names evidence today, and the
 * day something does, this test fails until somebody says whose it is. That is
 * the check the collective nouns never had — both were adopted, both went
 * stale, and nothing anywhere noticed.
 *
 * Run: npm test
