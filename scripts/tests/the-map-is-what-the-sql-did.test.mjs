/**
 * Check G — every rename the map records is a statement the series ran.
 *
 * `scripts/retired-vocabulary.mjs` is what a person or an agent reads to
 * answer "what did this word become?", and until #279 nothing held it against
 * the SQL. Its path-kind row said `unhappy` → `exception`; the migration says
 * `set kind = 'variant' where kind in ('unhappy', 'alternative')`, so both
 * spellings folded onto `variant` and `exception` was never a destination at
 * all. A map that is only a comment drifts, and a drifted map aims a sweep in
 * a direction the database never went. #267 is what that costs.
 *
 * SUBJECT: every pair of every row THAT NAMES A MIGRATION, against the files
 * in `supabase/migrations/` that row names. A row naming no migration —
 * `pill`/`chip`, the design system's own vocabulary — is outside this file
 * entirely, because there is no SQL for it to agree or disagree with; what
 * holds that row is `scripts/tests/badge-and-tag.test.mjs`.
 *
 * ── WHAT A PAIR HAS TO LOOK LIKE ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The check is not a search for two words in a file. It reads the row's
 * migrations down to their TOP-LEVEL STATEMENTS — comments removed and
 * dollar-quoted bodies removed, so a rewritten function body and a header
 * paragraph are both out — and then asks, for the SHAPE of the pair, whether
 * the statement that would perform it is there:
 *
 *   `t.c = 'a'` → `t.c = 'b'`   an `update public.t` that sets `c = 'b'` and
 *                               names `'a'`. The fold is caught here: a
 *                               destination the update never sets is a lie
 *                               however plausible it reads.
 *   `t.c` → `u.d`               an `alter table … rename column c to d`. The
 *                               TABLE is not matched, because half these
 *                               renames move the column while the table is
 *                               being renamed around it — `slice_items.caption`
 *                               became `slides.title` in two statements.
 *   `a` → `b` (bare, or `*_a`)  a bare name is a table, a column or a lane
 *                               role, so any of the three literal forms will
 *                               do: `rename to`, `rename column … to`, or an
 *                               update that turns one value into the other.
 *
 * ── THE ESCAPE, AND WHY IT HAS TEETH ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not every rename is a statement. `path.triggers` is a member of an authored
 * JSON file; `cell_touchpoints.url` was COPIED into another table and then
 * dropped; `step_visual` went nowhere. Those pairs carry a `because`, and a
 * `because` is not a way out: this file asserts the statement is genuinely
 * ABSENT. Declaring `because` on a pair whose `update` or `rename` is right
 * there in the migration fails, which is the only thing that stops the excuse
 * becoming the way to silence a real disagreement. A pair whose shape is not
 * one of the three and which carries no `because` fails as well, so no pair
 * escapes by being unreadable.
 *
 * A pair whose `to` is `null` is the fourth shape, and the one case where
 * `because` is a claim rather than an excuse: the name was DROPPED, so the
 * migrations must be seen NOT to move it, and the sentence saying why is
 * required — "nowhere" is the one destination a reader will not take on trust.
 *
 * `kept` is the other direction: a value the fold did NOT move to. It fails if
 * it is on the right of a pair in its own row, or if any of the row's
 * migrations sets the column to it. Both halves go red on the original defect.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS AND NOT SOMETHING CHEAPER ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * REPLAYING THE SERIES and reading the catalogue would be the strongest check
 * and is the one this repository already refuses elsewhere: `check:identifiers`
 * needs a local Postgres role and fails on environment, so it cannot be the
 * thing that holds a text file. Statements are what every developer has.
 *
 * A CENSUS — "the map has 23 rows and 46 pairs" — was rejected on the rule
 * this codebase states about assertions: it would break on the next unrelated
 * rename and teach the next person to edit the number. Nothing here counts.
 * Every assertion is per-pair, and a row added tomorrow is checked tomorrow
 * without this file changing.
 *
 * SEARCHING THE WHOLE FILE for both words, rather than one statement, is the
 * shape that would have passed the defect: `21000116000000` names `exception`
 * four times — in its header, in the new CHECK, in a column comment — and
 * never once as something a row was set to. Statement granularity is the
 * difference between a check and a keyword search.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN ──────────────────────────
 *
 * It reads TEXT, so it proves a statement was WRITTEN, not that it took
 * effect. `21000129000000` exists because a rename that ran can still leave
 * the name behind in a place no reader looks; nothing here would have caught
 * that, and `check:identifiers` against a real catalogue is what does.
 *
 * Statement splitting is on `;` outside dollar quotes. A semicolon inside a
 * single-quoted literal would split a statement in two; none of the 44
 * migrations has one, and the failure mode is a false ALARM rather than a
 * false pass, which is the direction a guard should fail in.
 *
 * It cannot check a pair it has no shape for, which is the whole reason
 * `because` has to be true rather than merely present.
