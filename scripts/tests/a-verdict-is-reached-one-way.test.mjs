/**
 * EVERY CHECK CONCLUDES THE SAME FOUR WAYS, AND ONE MODULE DECIDES WHICH.
 *
 * `verdict.mjs` is the half of a check that used to be copied: the summary
 * line, the empty-subject rule, and the exit. The copies disagreed — seventeen
 * checks called `process.exit(1)` and seven set `process.exitCode`, which are
 * different promises about the output already queued — and the disagreement
 * was invisible because each copy was read beside its own check rather than
 * beside the others.
 *
 * So the four outcomes are driven here, once, through seams instead of a
 * process: what went to stdout, what went to stderr, what the exit code became,
 * and what landed in the unverified register. A check's own suite is then free
 * to be about its judgement, which is the only part of it that differs.
 *
 * Run: npm test
