 * the APPLICATION names the `app` subject of `sweep.mjs`. A script that measures
 * THIS REPOSITORY — a generator writing into its own `src/data`, the vendoring
 * sync, a sweep of what this commit would carry — says so on the
 * repository-only list below, with the reason, so that the next sweep through
 * these files does not re-decide the same handful.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CHECKED HERE is whether a resolving script resolves EVERY path
 * it names; a file that names the `app` subject is taken at its word. This
