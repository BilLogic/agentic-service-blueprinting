/**
 * A form key is a column, and a column arrives under its own name.
 *
 * `cells.description` became `cells.summary`. Twelve days later the cell
 * editor's form still said `description` — filled from `content.summary`,
 * written back to `summary`, and the word survived in between, in the one
 * layer no check reads. Two more copies sat in the app's own cell types,
 * filled straight from `cell.summary`.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because nothing could. `check-retired-identifiers` replays
 * the live database. `labels-name-their-columns` reads what a reader sees. A
 * form's state key is neither: it never reaches the schema and never reaches
 * the screen. `tsc` cannot help either — the key is renamed at both edges, so
 * the types agree with themselves.
 *
 * TWO SUBJECTS, BOTH NARROW.
 *
 * 1. THE EDITOR FORM TYPES. Each panel declares a `FormState` for the table it
 *    saves to; every key must be a column of that table, spelled in camelCase.
 *    The panel→table map below is a declaration of the subject — which table a
 *    form edits is a fact this file has to be told — not a list of pardons.
 *    `suffix` is how a key that genuinely cannot be spelled as its column
 *    names the column anyway, with its reason beside it. No current form needs
 *    one: the two that did — `functionText` and `formText` on the cell editor,
 *    for columns this app cannot use as bare identifiers without shadowing the
 *    keyword and the element — left with that form when its state became a
 *    type derived from the schema. The mechanism stays for the next column that
 *    cannot be spelled, because a reason beside the key is the only place such
 *    a decision can live.
 *
 * 2. THE ASSIGNMENT SITE. `description: cell.summary` is a column changing its
 *    name on the way into the app, and it is the exact shape every renamed
 *    column takes when it drifts. The rename roster in `retired-vocabulary`
 *    already knows each pair; this reads the pairs and looks for `was: x.is`.
 *    Only qualified reads (`something.summary`) are matched, so a literal
 *    `description: 'Clear the selection.'` on a command is not a finding.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT JUDGE: a type that presents a row rather than mirrors one.
 * `phasesToSlides` gives every slide a `title` and a `summary` whatever the
 * source table calls them; that is a display vocabulary, and it is checked by
 * the second subject only where it is fed from a renamed column.
 *
 * Run: npm test

 * application in `node_modules/agentic-service-blueprinting`, not beside its
 * `scripts/`. `resolve(process.cwd(), 'src/…')` named a file that is not
 * there, and a walk rooted at `resolve(REPO_ROOT, 'src')` named a directory
