/**
 * Is this still the template's blueprint, or is it yours?
 *
 * Two guards already sweep for content leaking the wrong way.
 * `check:standalone` reads the NAMES of the deployment this template was
 * generalised from; `check:content-coupling` reads that deployment's CONTENT
 * with the name filed off — a cell id copied out of its database, one of its
 * lane actors, one of its scenario titles. Both face the same way: they
 * protect the template from the deployment it came out of. Neither faces an
 * adopter, and until this file nothing in the repository did.
 *
 * This is the mirror. It knows the SAMPLE's own markers — the meta-blueprint,
 * the service blueprint of this template itself — and reports where a deployment
 * is still carrying them.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-sample-content.mjs   (also: npm run check:sample-content)
 *   node scripts/check-sample-content.mjs --all   (every site, not a sample)
 *
 * ── Advisory. It reports and exits 0, deliberately ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Every other check in `docs/engineering/checks.md` goes red on what it
 * finds. This one must not, for two reasons that are both about who is
 * reading it.
 *
 * A FRESH CLONE IS FULL OF SAMPLE CONTENT ON PURPOSE. `supabase/seed.sql` is
 * a real blueprint — of this template — and SETUP.md § 2 asks a new reader to run
 * the app against it before configuring anything. A check that failed here
 * would fail the state the template ships in, which is not a defect to fix but the
 * front door.
 *
 * A HALF-MIGRATED DEPLOYMENT IS A LEGITIMATE STATE. Adoption is a sequence:
 * the seed goes first, the offline fallback registry follows, and there are
 * days in between when both are true at once. Failing a build on the middle
 * of a supported path teaches its owner to stop reading build output, and a
 * guard whose readers have learned to skip it is worse than no guard.
 *
 * So the exit code is 0 whatever it finds, the report says so in its own
 * words, and the only thing this check ever asks of anybody is that they read
 * it. Its CI counterpart does not exist for the same reason: in this
 * repository it would report the sample on every pull request, forever, and
 * correctly.
 *
 * ── The subject ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Only the two places a DEPLOYMENT'S CONTENT lives:
 *
 *   - the seed the database is loaded from — whatever `[db.seed]` in
 *     `supabase/config.toml` names, read with `resolveSeedFiles` from
 *     `check-deployment-seed-loads.mjs` so a deployment that renamed or split
 *     its seed is still swept;
 *   - `src/data/`, the board the app renders when no database is configured.
 *     That is the directory `scripts/generate_fallbacks.py --register`
 *     rewrites, and its marker-delimited blocks are where an adopter's own
 *     content lands.
 *
 * Everything else in the tree is out, and this is the whole reason the check
 * can reach zero. `scripts/generate_sample_blueprint.mjs` IS the sample and
 * always will be. `docs/connectors/supabase/database.md` quotes it as an
 * example. `README.md` and `SETUP.md` describe it by name. None of those is
 * a deployment's content, none of them goes away on adoption, and a sweep
 * that reported them would never reach zero on any deployment, ever — which
 * is the failure mode where a report becomes wallpaper.
 *
 * Tests are out, for the reason `check-content-coupling.mjs` states next
 * door: a fixture has to be able to write the value down, and this check's
 * own fixtures have to be able to plant one.
 *
 * ── The markers, and why each is drawn the way it is ───────────────────────
 *
 * 1. THE SAMPLE SERVICE. `Keeping a blueprint true`, and the slug
 *    `keeping-a-blueprint-true` the seed writes beside it. This is the
 *    anchor: no adopter writes that sentence by accident, and one hit is
 *    enough to know whose board is loaded.
 *
 * 2. THE SAMPLE'S OWN ID NAMESPACE. `f0000000-0000-4000-8000-…`, minted by
 *    `fid()` in `scripts/generate_sample_blueprint.mjs`. This is the marker
 *    with the NAME FILED OFF — thirty-two hex digits that say nothing, and
 *    the reason a deployment can look entirely its own in prose and still be
 *    keyed on the template's rows. The constant is imported from
 *    `check-content-coupling.mjs` rather than copied, because the two guards
 *    are one claim read from two sides: the prefix that guard trusts as proof
 *    of origin is the prefix this one reports.
 *
 * 3. THE SAMPLE'S SCENARIO TITLES. The six the generator asserts, matched as
 *    whole phrases. These are the softest of the three and are ranked last on
 *    purpose — see below.
 *
 * ── What is NOT matched, deliberately ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE PHASE NAMES. `Discover`, `Setup`, `Operate`, `Maintain` are four of the
 * most ordinary words a service blueprint can carry, and any adopter may
 * reach for all four. Matching them would report a deployment for having
 * phases.
 *
 * THE LANE ACTORS. `Blueprint owner`, `Stakeholders`, `Claude in the IDE`.
 * The first two are the vocabulary this template teaches — `CONTEXT.md` and the
 * skills use them as the generic cast — so an adopter who names a lane
 * `Blueprint owner` has taken the template's ADVICE, not left its content behind.
 *
 * THE PATH NAMES. `A first look`, `From your documents`, `Findings triaged`.
 * Ordinary English describing an ordinary branch. Same failure as the phases.
 *
 * And the boundary this check cannot cross, stated rather than papered over:
 * A DEPLOYMENT THAT BLUEPRINTS A BLUEPRINTING SERVICE. Marker 3 is the one
 * that can cry wolf — a team mapping their own use of this template could
 * honestly write `Map your service` as a scenario title. Two things keep that
 * from being a reason not to ship the check. The report says which marker
 * caught each line, so `the sample's scenario titles` and `the sample's own
 * id namespace` never arrive as one undifferentiated number and a reader can
 * dismiss the first while acting on the second. And the consequence of a
 * false positive here is a sentence somebody reads and disagrees with, not a
 * red build — which is the whole argument for the check being advisory, made
 * from the other end.
