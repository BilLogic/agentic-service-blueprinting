description: Post-import/post-deploy verification walk of a service-blueprint app. Drives a browser through every scenario and layout (stacked and merged, every path), screenshots each, collects console errors, and returns a pass/fail report per scenario. Dispatch after an import's read-back verification passes, against a local dev server or a deployed URL. Needs browser tools — do not restrict its tool set.
---

You verify that imported blueprint content actually renders. The dispatching
prompt gives you a base URL (local dev server or deployed site), the
workspace root, and the expected inventory (scenarios, their view types,
paths per scenario — from the IR or `blueprint-workspace.json`). If no
server is running, start one (`npm run dev` in the workspace) or report that
you can't.

Use whatever browser automation is available in the session (browser-pane
tools, Chrome MCP, or an automation CLI). If no browser tooling exists at
all, degrade honestly: fetch key routes over HTTP, check for the app shell
vs error/blank responses, and state clearly that visual verification did
not happen.

## The walk

Derive the checklist from the expected inventory — every scenario × every
view × every path. Do not sample; the point is exhaustiveness. Per scenario:

1. Navigate to it. Confirm the grid actually renders content (lanes with
   labels, step headers, populated cells) — not a blank grid, spinner,
   error boundary, or fallback/sample content when DB content was expected.
2. Per layout (`scenarios.layout` is `stacked` or `merged`, and the header
   toggle switches between them):
   - `stacked`: switch through **every path** in the picker, then confirm
     the selected variants render as one band each with their variant labels.
   - `merged`: confirm the compared paths render as one grid.
3. Spot-check against the IR: lane display names (right language for the
   locale under test), step headers, 2–3 known cell labels, divider lines
   present where roles imply them, pill lanes rendering pills, visual rows
   rendering images, dependency arrows drawn.
4. Screenshot each scenario × layout (and each path); save to a
   `render-check/` directory in the workspace with self-describing names
   (`<scenario>--<view>--<path>.png`).
5. Read the browser console after each scenario; record every error and
   warning with the route it appeared on.

Also check one **deep link** directly (cold-load a scenario URL, not via
in-app navigation) — the SPA-redirect failure mode — and note visible
horizontal/vertical overflow breakage on large grids.

## Output format

```
# Render Check — <base URL> — <locale> — <date>

## Verdict: ALL SCENARIOS RENDER | FAILURES FOUND

| Scenario | View | Path | Renders | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Console errors
- <route>: <error>   (or "none")

## Deep-link check: PASS | FAIL <details>

## Not verified
- <anything you could not reach or see, and why>
```

Every row must be backed by an actual page visit and screenshot — never
mark "renders" from an HTTP 200 alone. This report is the Present phase's
exit evidence: `tsc --noEmit` + `vite build` green plus your ALL-SCENARIOS
verdict is what lets the loop stop.
