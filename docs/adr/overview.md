summary: What earns an ADR here, the numbering and template, the current set, and the mapping from the deployment records that moved in.

# Decision records

An ADR here records a choice that is **surprising without context** or **hard
to reverse** — the two together, usually. Not every decision: most of what
this codebase does is ordinary and belongs in the files it lives in, which
describe rather than justify.

The test is a future reader's question. If someone six months from now will
look at the code and think *"that is the wrong way round, I'll fix it"* — and
be wrong — the reasoning owes them a record. If they would simply nod, it
does not.

## Shape

`NNNN-a-sentence-in-the-imperative-or-the-present.md`, numbered in the order
they were accepted, never renumbered. Frontmatter carries a `summary` (which
is what the generated index shows). The body states the decision, then why,
then a **Consequences** section that names what the decision costs and —
where there is one — the plausible "fix" that would undo it.

A superseded record keeps its number and its file, and says what replaced
it. A deleted ADR is a decision nobody can find the reasoning for.

After #551, a number that could be read from
[BilLogic/plus-uno-blueprint](https://github.com/BilLogic/plus-uno-blueprint)
is written with the repository as well as the number. The two folders do not
share a sequence: this folder's 0013 is TypeScript owning layout numbers;
that repository's 0013 is the import decision, which lives here as 0020.

## Moved here from BilLogic/plus-uno-blueprint (#551)

Nine records moved, renumbered after 0012 (reserved for the type system).
Companion BilLogic/plus-uno-blueprint#617 turns the deployment copies into
pointers and needs this mapping:

| BilLogic/plus-uno-blueprint | This folder |
|---|---|
| 0002 | [0013](0013-typescript-owns-layout-numbers.md) |
| 0003 | [0014](0014-vendored-primitives-stay-pristine.md) |
| 0004 | [0015](0015-the-board-is-always-fully-mounted.md) |
| 0006 | [0016](0016-reads-never-refetch-on-their-own.md) |
| 0008 | [0017](0017-large-component-splits-wait-for-an-end-to-end-round.md) |
| 0011 | [0018](0018-featured-is-one-column-two-verbs.md) |
| 0012 | [0019](0019-the-deployment-is-a-deployment-of-the-template.md) |
| 0013 | [0020](0020-the-deployment-imports-the-template.md) |
| 0015 | [0021](0021-the-template-owns-the-agent.md) |

Five pairs were already mirrored. Where they disagreed, the schema or the
code in this tree decided:

| BilLogic/plus-uno-blueprint | This folder | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 | [0006](0006-one-token-model-is-the-single-style-seam.md) | This copy stands. The compiled artifact is not in the model (`tokenModel.ts`). |
| 0005 | [0005](0005-cross-surface-state-is-a-module-store.md) | Union of instance lists against the tree: `canvasModeContext.ts` and `canvasChromeResize.ts` added. |
| 0010 | [0007](0007-the-canvas-and-the-shell-run-on-separate-clocks.md) | This copy stands. It already carried the supersession by [0010](0010-open-views-stay-mounted.md). |
| 0014 | [0003](0003-a-service-owns-its-journey-and-shares-the-catalog.md) | This copy gained slice on the journey boundary (`slices.service_id` is `NOT NULL`). |
| 0016 | [0009](0009-the-queue-is-issues-and-a-durable-decision-is-an-adr.md) | This copy stands. This tree never held the folders that copy retired. |

Two records stay in the deployment alone: its advisor warnings, and its
migration history.
