summary: When a deployment holds more than one service, the journey entities (phase, scenario, path, step, lane, cell) are a hard per-service boundary while the catalog of nouns a journey references — touchpoints and stakeholders both — is one deployment-level pool where the name is the identity and a service's membership is implicit in what its journey references, so a tool or actor is recorded once and reused across services without a palette to author or keep in sync.

# 3. A service owns its journey and shares the catalog

**Status** Accepted — 2026-09-04
**Context** `supabase/migrations/21000125000000_an_entity_has_a_status_and_a_lane_names_its_actor.sql`,
which lands the first half; the deployment this template was generalised from
made the decision first and holds both halves.

## Context

A deployment can hold more than one service. That forces a domain question the
single-service model never had to answer: when there are two services, what is
each service's own, and what do they share?

The catalog holds two kinds of noun. **Touchpoints** — the tools, documents and
channels a moment happens through — are a registry this core already carries,
scoped `unique (service_id, name)`. **Stakeholders** — the actors whose work a
lane holds — arrive with the migration above. Both are reference data a journey
points at: a cell places a touchpoint, a lane picks a stakeholder. The question
is whether that reference data is a service's or the deployment's.

## Decision

**A service owns its journey; the catalog of nouns its journey references is the
deployment's.**

- The **journey** — phase, scenario, path, step, lane, cell — is a **hard**
  boundary: mutually exclusive per service, never crossing. Two services' boards
  do not share a phase or a lane.
- The **catalog** — the nouns a journey points at — is **soft**: one
  deployment-level pool holding both touchpoints (the tools) and stakeholders
  (the actors). A cell references a shared touchpoint; a lane references a
  shared stakeholder; the references are per-service, the referents are the
  deployment's.

Two rules give the catalog its shape: the **name is the identity** (one pool,
unique by name across the deployment), and a service's **membership is
implicit** (a service "has" a catalog entry exactly when its journey references
it — there is no palette to author).

### Why the catalog holds actors too, and not just tools

The tools are obviously shareable — the same Zoom touches several of an org's
services. The open question was the actors: a stakeholder attaches to a lane,
and lanes are journey (hard), so it was tempting to leave stakeholders
per-service. Three things settle it the other way.

First, **coherence**: a touchpoint will carry a `stakeholder_id` — its owner. If
touchpoints were a deployment-level pool but stakeholders stayed per-service, a
shared touchpoint's owner would have to be *one* service's actor — which one?
The split is the incoherent option, not the safe one.

Second, **the model already reads this way**: a lane does not define its actor,
it **picks one from a shared cast**. The stakeholder registry is a pool of
reference data a lane selects from, exactly the shared-catalog shape. Making the
pool deployment-wide is what the picker already wants.

Third, **cost is symmetric**: a per-service `stakeholders` and a per-service
`touchpoints` would be structural twins — a registry with `unique (service_id,
name)`, referenced by a journey entity. Sharing an actor is the same reshape as
sharing a tool, not a larger one, so the choice is domain merit, not effort —
and the same actor ("the student") does recur across an org's services just as
the same tool does.

### Why the name is the identity

A touchpoint is minted by name — a cell's text names a tool and the catalog gets
a row. In one pool, a **deployment-unique name** is how a second service reuses
an entry: it names the same tool the same way and references the row that
already exists. If two services run *different* tools, they carry *different*
names — "Gmail" and "Outlook", not two rows both called "Email". Distinct nouns
take distinct names; an identical name means the identical thing.

The rejected alternative was independent identity — each service keeps its own
"Email" and any sharing is declared explicitly. That defeats the reason the
catalog exists (record a tool once, reference it everywhere) and puts the burden
of sharing on an authoring step instead of on the name.

### Why membership is implicit

A service "has" a catalog entry exactly when its journey references it — a
touchpoint when one of its cells places it, a stakeholder when one of its lanes
picks it. There is **no `service_touchpoints` / `service_stakeholders` link
table**, no authored palette.

- Touchpoints are **created inline** — minted from a cell's text by the sync
  function, with no "add a tool to this service" gesture anywhere. Implicit is
  the only model coherent with how a touchpoint is born.
- Stakeholders are **picked from the pool** by a lane, which is implicit by
  definition — a curated per-service cast list would be a second thing to keep
  in step with what the lanes actually use.
- Implicit is **divergence-free**. An explicit palette can drift from reality —
  an entry "in the palette" no journey uses, or the reverse. Implicit makes a
  service's set exactly its usage.

The one thing implicit gives up is picker scoping: authoring a service shows the
whole deployment catalog rather than a curated subset. At the expected scale
(the common case is a single service; multi-service is a handful) that is fine,
and "this service's already-used entries first" is a read-side sort, not a
table. An explicit palette stays a **clean additive step** for later — it can be
added over the shared catalog without reshaping it — so implicit now is the
deferral, not a corner.

## Consequences

- **`stakeholders` is born deployment-level.** It never carries a `service_id`;
  `stakeholders_name_key` is `unique (name)` across the whole deployment. A lane
  names its actor by a nullable `lanes.stakeholder_id`; a structural lane names
  nobody.
- **`touchpoints` makes the same move in a later migration**, dropping its
  `service_id` and re-uniquing on `(name)`. Until then the registry is a
  service's, the touchpoint sync mints `on conflict (service_id, name)`, and
  `CONTEXT.md`'s touchpoint entry keeps saying "per service" — that entry
  reverses in the migration that drops the column, which is where the argument
  is written.
- **`touchpoints.stakeholder_id` waits for that move.** A link from a
  service-scoped tool to a deployment-scoped actor is the incoherence the first
  argument above names; it is added once both ends are the deployment's.
- The **registry becomes a deployment-level library**: a catalog can hold a tool
  or actor no current journey uses, which at deployment scope is a feature (a
  shelf of the org's tools), not an accidental accumulation.
- An agent's per-service search scope derives a service's catalog from its
  journey's references, since membership is implicit — a join, not a membership
  lookup.

## Still open

- **An explicit per-service palette** is deferred by design — additive over the
  shared catalog if a large deployment ever finds the picker noisy, and recorded
  here only so a future reader knows it was a deliberate deferral, not an
  oversight.
- **The name-collision authoring nicety** — guiding an author who names a new
  tool with a name the deployment already uses for a different one — is UX, not
  model, and needs no record until it is built.
