summary: A skill is invoked by its official namespaced name — `/sb:audit`, never `/audit` — and the bare segment after the colon keeps one job, finding the skill in the composer's menu and suggesting it when a reader types it as a token; one canonical spelling invokes, so a transcript, a ticket and a prompt all name a skill the same way, and the alias becomes the near-miss hint the silent-token notice needs.

# 26. A skill is invoked by its official name; its alias only finds it

**Status** Accepted — 2026-09-17. Reverses the bare-alias resolution the
composer shipped with.
**Context** `src/lib/agent/skills.ts`,
`src/components/editor/agent/AgentChatView.tsx`, § The agent in
[`CONTEXT.md`](../../CONTEXT.md)

## Context

Every skill has two spellings. The official one is namespaced to match the
plugin invocation exactly — `/sb:audit` in the composer and `/sb:audit` in an
IDE are the same `SKILL.md` — and beside it sat a bare alias, `/audit`,
resolving to the same skill. The comment that introduced the aliases said what
they were for: muscle memory.

Both spellings resolved, and so a skill had no canonical name at the only
moment naming matters. A transcript recorded whichever the reader typed, a
ticket quoted whichever its author remembered, and a reader who learned
`/audit` here found nothing under that name anywhere else the skill is
published.

The cost arrived attached to a different failure. A reader typed a skill name
inside a sentence rather than at its head, the composer recognised no token
there, and the message sent as prose — no skill loaded, and nothing said so.
Fixing the trigger raised the naming question, because a lookup that fires
mid-sentence fires on far more tokens, and every token it resolves is a
message it can silently turn into a skill run. A message that merely
*mentions* `/audit` is a sentence a reader wrote, not an invocation.

## Decision

The official namespaced name invokes a skill. `findSkillByToken` matches ids
and nothing else.

The alias keeps two jobs, both of which stop short of running anything. It
matches in the composer's menu, so a reader still types `aud` and finds
`/sb:audit` without typing the namespace first. And it is the source of the
near-miss suggestion: a token that resolves to no skill but matches an alias
produces "closest match: `/sb:audit`", offered for the reader to accept.

This is the same division the tool this composer mirrors draws. Its matcher
tests a command's full name, the segment after its last colon and its display
name; its dispatch takes the canonical name; and when a typed token names
nothing available, it tells the model the token did not run and names the
closest command rather than guessing.

## Consequences

**Muscle memory retrains, once.** A reader who types `/audit` no longer runs
the audit — they are offered it. That is the reversal, and it is deliberate:
the offer is what makes the mid-sentence lookup safe to have at all.

**An alias is half-alive on purpose.** A future reader finds `aliases` in the
skill definition and finds nothing resolving them, which reads like a bug
unless this is written down. It is searched and suggested, never resolved.

**The silent-token notice depends on it.** Without aliases as a near-miss
source, a token that stops resolving stops being recognised, and the notice
that exists to break the silence goes quiet in exactly the case a reader is
most likely to hit. The alias is what keeps the suggestion possible.

**Both spellings stay in the glossary.** § The agent names the official form
as the one that invokes and the bare segment as the one that finds, because a
term spelled two ways in the interface is spelled both ways here.
