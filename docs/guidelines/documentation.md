summary: The documentation grammar this repo follows — five root files each answering one question, docs/ for authored protocol, class-named folders, overview.md authored and index.md generated, a summary in every doc's frontmatter, and the one exception the plugin contract holds.

# Writing documentation here

**For** anyone adding or moving a document.
**Answers** where does this go, and what has to be in it?

## 1. Five root files, one question each

| File | The question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | What is this, and why would I want it? |
| `CONTEXT.md` | What does this word mean? |
| `SETUP.md` | How do I get it running? |
| `INDEX.md` | Where is the thing I need? *(generated)* |
| `AGENTS.md` | I am an agent — what do I read, and what am I not allowed to do? |

Nothing else lands at the root. A file that wants to is answering one of these
five questions, and belongs inside the one it answers.

## 2. `docs/` holds authored protocol

Folders are named for the class of thing inside them.

| Folder | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `adr/` | Decisions, numbered, with the context that forced them. Never edited after acceptance — a decision that changed gets a new ADR that supersedes it. |
| `agents/` | Repository-specific configuration consumed by engineering skills. |
| `guide/` | The numbered narrative, for a person reading start to finish. |
| `guidelines/` | How we work: this file, and how to propose a change. |
| `engineering/` | Procedure for whoever runs the repository. |
| `connectors/<name>/` | Everything about one external system this package talks to. |
| `plans/` | History. See [the plans overview](../plans/overview.md). |
| `assets/` | Every figure the README and the guides use. |

`overview.md` is authored and says what a tree holds. `index.md` is generated
and lists what is in it. They are never the same file, and neither is ever
edited by hand into the other's job.

**The guide links into the protocol; it does not restate it.** A rule has one
home. When the guide needs a rule, it names the file the rule lives in.
Two copies of a rule is one rule and one lie, and the guide is where the lie
usually ends up, because it reads well and nobody diffs prose.

## 3. Every doc carries a summary

Every `.md` under `docs/` opens with frontmatter carrying a `summary:` — one
sentence, on one line, saying what the document answers.

```markdown
---
summary: How a release is cut — changesets bump package.json, plugin.json and the CHANGELOG derive from it, and every release ends in an annotated tag.
---
```

It is not decoration. `scripts/generate-docs-index.mjs` builds `INDEX.md` and
`docs/index.md` out of these lines, so the summary is what an agent reads when
deciding whether to open the file. A document without one **fails
`npm run check:docs-index`**, which names the file. Write the summary for
someone deciding whether this is the document they want, not as a title
restated.

Documents under `docs/plans/` carry a `status:` as well; they are history, and
the index says so.

## 4. The exception

`skills/`, `references/`, `agents/`, `hooks/` and `scripts/` do not follow any
of this. They are resolved by path at runtime through the plugin root, so
their names are a published interface rather than an organising choice, and
`references/` in particular is normative protocol that stays at the root.
The reasoning is [ADR 2](../adr/0002-plugin-contract-folder-names.md); read it
before tidying them.
