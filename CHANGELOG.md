# Changelog

All notable changes to the `service-blueprinting` plugin are documented here.
The plugin and the blueprint template app share this repository and version
together (workspace plugin version = template version).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-16

Initial plugin scaffold.

- `service-blueprinting` skill: entry-state detection, playbook gating, hard
  rules (validator gate, hash-bound sign-off, system-vs-journey refusal,
  secrets rules, target confirmation, co-equal backend choice), deterministic
  per-phase exit conditions.
- Agents: `document-reader` (corpus survey / deep read / foreign-blueprint
  extraction), `blueprint-reviewer` (fresh-context adversarial IR review),
  `render-checker` (post-import browser walk with screenshots).
- Hooks: session-start workspace status, post-edit IR auto-validation,
  pre-write service-role secret guard.
- References: IR JSON Schema, crosswalk JSON Schema, data model, layer roles,
  adapter contract, workspace-state spec, ingest / co-create / translate /
  review-import playbooks, elicitation protocol, deploy notes, customization
  guide.
- Assets: `HANDOFF.md.template` for per-workspace maintenance handoff.
- Not yet included (next units): `scripts/validate_ir.py`,
  `scripts/generate_seed_sql.py`, `scripts/generate_fallbacks.py`,
  `assets/schema.ddl.sql`, `assets/policies.supabase.sql`, marketplace entry.
