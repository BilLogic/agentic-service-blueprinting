# Changelog

All notable changes to the `sb` plugin (formerly `service-blueprinting`) are
documented here. The plugin and the blueprint template app share this
repository and version together (workspace plugin version = template version).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-05

Plugin renamed `service-blueprinting` → `sb`; skills renamed to bare tokens
(`map`, `slice`, `audit`, `whatif`) so invocations read `sb:map`, `sb:slice`,
`sb:audit`, `sb:whatif` on every surface (IDE plugin and canvas composer).
Prose references swept across skills, references, agents, and hooks.

Canvas translation upgraded from read-only to full write parity:

- `sb:audit` on canvas records findings rows via `record_finding` with the
  same dedupe discipline (open updates in place, dismissed stays dismissed,
  resolved reopens); triage via `set_finding_status`; ledger via
  `list_findings`. Canvas cell identity uses cell ids (cell_keys written as
  ids), so canvas and IDE fingerprints are separate dedupe spaces.
- `sb:whatif` on canvas keeps the variant conversational (analysis never
  writes cells), records consequence findings (source `whatif`), and on
  explicit acceptance promotes directly through the ordinary canvas write
  tools; optimistic-concurrency tokens replace the hash staleness guard.
- `references/canvas-adapter.md`, `references/audit-playbook.md` §6, and
  `references/whatif-playbook.md` §5 carry the updated translation.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-16

Initial plugin scaffold.

- `service-blueprinting` skill: entry-state detection, playbook gating, hard
  rules (validator gate, hash-bound sign-off, system-vs-journey refusal,
  secrets rules, target confirmation, co-equal backend choice), deterministic
  per-phase exit conditions.
- Agents: `document-reader` (corpus survey / deep read / foreign-blueprint
  extraction), `blueprint-reviewer` (fresh-context adversarial IR review),
  `render-checker` (post-import browser walk with screenshots).
- Hooks: session-start workspace status, post-edit IR auto-validation,
  pre-write service-role secret guard.
- References: IR JSON Schema, crosswalk JSON Schema, data model, layer roles,
  adapter contract, workspace-state spec, ingest / co-create / translate /
  review-import playbooks, elicitation protocol, deploy notes, customization
  guide.
- Assets: `HANDOFF.md.template` for per-workspace maintenance handoff.
- Not yet included (next units): `scripts/validate_ir.py`,
  `scripts/generate_seed_sql.py`, `scripts/generate_fallbacks.py`,
  `assets/schema.ddl.sql`, `assets/policies.supabase.sql`, marketplace entry.
