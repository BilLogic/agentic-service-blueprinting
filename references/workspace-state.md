# Workspace State: blueprint-workspace.json

The single cross-phase coupling point. Lives at the **workspace root**
(the template clone the org works in), git-tracked, next to the `blueprint/`
IR directory. Enables resume, per-scenario progress, sign-off integrity,
idempotent re-import, and the update loop. The SessionStart hook reads it to
inject a status summary; every phase checks its preconditions against it.

## Fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Template schema version of the workspace clone. Import compat-checks the IR's `schema_version` against it; mismatch routes to the upgrade recipe in `references/customization.md` |
| `ir_path` | Workspace-relative path to the IR JSON |
| `locales` | Authored locales; one target per locale |
| `scenarios` | **Per-scenario status map**, keyed by IR scenario key — partial completion is a promise ("2 of 6 now, more later"). Each signed scenario carries its own `content_hash` + `signed_at`/`signed_by` — the hash-bound gate (below) |
| `targets` | Per-locale import target + deploy record |

### Scenario status values

`pending → drafted → reviewed → signed_off → imported`

- `drafted`: IR content exists and `validate_ir.py` exits 0.
- `reviewed`: `blueprint-reviewer` findings resolved.
- `signed_off`: the scenario's stored `content_hash` matches its current
  subtree hash from `scripts/compute_signoff_hash.py`.
- `imported`: read-back verification passed on every locale's target.

Statuses give goal-based loops verifiable criteria ("all 6 scenarios
signed off") — update them the moment a phase's exit condition is met,
never speculatively.

### Sign-off (⚠ REQUIRED semantics)

Sign-off binds **per scenario**, not per file. When the user explicitly
approves a previewed scenario, record that scenario's
`content_hash` (from `scripts/compute_signoff_hash.py <ir> --scenario <key>`)
plus `signed_at`/`signed_by` on its `scenarios` entry, and set its status to
`signed_off`. The hash is a canonical SHA-256 of that scenario's subtree (all
locales inline), so it is stable across machines and re-serializations.

Import must recompute each scenario's hash and **refuse on mismatch** for that
scenario — a hand-edit after approval de-signs only the scenario it touched and
re-gates that scenario's review. Because the hash is per-scenario, appending a
new phase/scenario to the IR leaves every previously signed scenario's hash
unchanged (they stay `signed_off`) — the whole-file hash this replaced
de-signed everything on any edit (friction #19). Recording a hash without an
explicit user approval defeats the gate; don't.

A top-level `sign_off` object (whole-IR hash) is no longer the gate. It may be
kept as an optional convenience record, but per-scenario `content_hash` is
authoritative.

### Targets

Per locale: `mode` (`fallback` | `supabase`), `project_ref` (Supabase only),
`last_import` (`content_hash` + timestamp of the last verified import — the
baseline for the pre-import read-back diff), `deploy_url` (where this
locale's site lives, once deployed).

## Lifecycle notes

- Create the file when scaffolding the workspace, before any IR is written.
- Two authors collaborate via normal git branching; sign-off is per-branch.
- An inherited workspace (state file present, unknown provenance) is read,
  hash-verified, and resumed — full consistency audit is v2.
- `HANDOFF.md` (generated from `assets/HANDOFF.md.template`) is the
  human-readable companion to this machine-readable state.
