/**
 * The Lane corridor rule, once.
 *
 * A lane reserves headroom for its own dependencies in two shapes: a strip
 * ABOVE the row for a forward arrow that clears at least one column (the
 * overhead rail — the cells it skips are in the way, so it climbs, runs, and
 * drops back in), and a thinner strip above the row for a backward arrow
 * (the in-lane loop — it turns back over the row it started on). Both are
 * decided the same way: restrict to the lane, resolve each cell's step to
 * its column, and compare the two ends. A third corridor, BELOW the row the
 * line of interaction draws under, is the divider's business and stays with
 * the lane roles in `blueprintLayout`; this module only prices it.
 *
 * The single board and the side-by-side compare used to each own a copy of
 * the predicate, under names that clashed, and the compare's copy resolved
 * a canonical lane into each compared blueprint while the board's matched
 * by id alone — so the two could disagree on row height. There is one
 * predicate now, and it resolves the lane every time: for a single board
 * the id matches first and nothing changes; for a compare, every source is
 * asked about the lane it calls by that name.
 *
 * Every rule reads the data — which lane a cell sits in, which column its
 * step occupies — never a lane's name. A name is not an input.
