/**
 * The first undo of a first summary.
 *
 * Every one-column prose field starts null, so the FIRST save of one captures
 * `''` as its previous value — which makes "restore the empty" the commonest
 * revert in the ledger, not an edge case. `stringArg` refuses `''` on purpose
 * (an id never legitimately is one), and `update_service_summary` read its
 * value through it while the scenario and step cases did not. Reverting the
 * first service summary anyone wrote therefore threw "This change's revert is
 * missing its “summary” value" and left the field as typed.
 *
 * All three now read through `optionalStringArg`, so this asserts the same
 * thing three times rather than once: the empty string is the value, and the
 * write that clears the column actually runs.

 * shape: `position` was added to the captured row after entries were already
 * being recorded without it, and the key itself was written unconditionally
 * before it was omitted when the list is empty.
 *
 * Both older shapes have to keep reverting, and that is a claim about the
 * WHOLE chain rather than about this module: nothing here reads `position`,
 * and neither does `restore_cell_touchpoints`, whose row type names `name`,
 * `summary`, `role` and `resources` and nothing else. A placement's position
 * is captured because the sync hands it back, not because the restore needs
 * it. What these pin is that it stays that way — the day something starts
 * reading it, an entry recorded before it existed would revert onto a null.
 *
 * The resources nested inside are the one place a position IS read, and the
 * function already coalesces a missing one to the row's ordinal, which is the
 * same tolerance stated one level down.
