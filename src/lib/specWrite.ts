/**
 * The one way a spec is written, at every level that has one.
 *
 * CONTEXT.md says spec is four levels and one word — what a board object is
 * like, as opposed to where it sits — and a panel writes it over a
 * column-scoped grant rather than through an authoring RPC. The write was six
 * modules re-deriving the same six stations, comments included: normalise the
 * values, update the columns, translate the failure, require that a row was
 * written, refresh what the change shows in, and record the inverse. Six
 * copies of a rule is six places for the empty-is-null convention the read
 * path depends on to drift, and six places a new level has to be discovered
 * from rather than declared into.
 *
 * So the rule lives here once and a level declares what is genuinely its own:
 * its table, the column the write is addressed by, the columns a spec may
 * touch and how each is normalised, what the change makes stale, and the
 * shape of the inverse the ledger carries. `cellFields.ts` declares a cell's
 * columns the same way and for the same reason — the select and the
 * normalizer are functions of the list, so a column added there is added to
 * both in one edit.
 *
 * The stations, in the order they run and the order they must stay in:
 *
 *  1. **A target with nothing in it is refused.** A level addressed by a set
 *     of ids can be handed an empty one — the lane whose rows were deleted
 *     while its panel was open — and an update matching nothing is a write
 *     that reports success having done nothing.
 *  2. **The update**, over the declared columns, addressed by the declared
 *     column: one value with `eq`, a set with `in`.
 *  3. **The failure becomes a sentence** through `toAuthoringError`, which is
 *     where a revoked column grant turns into words a person can act on.
 *  4. **Zero rows is a failure, not a success.** PostgREST answers an update
 *     that matched nothing with a 200 and an empty array. Reverting one would
 *     drop the entry from the ledger having written nothing — see
 *     `requireRowsWritten`, which is also why the query selects.
 *  5. **What the change shows in is refetched.** A level knows what draws it.
 *  6. **The inverse is recorded**, unless the caller is the revert path. A
 *     direct table write is one `call()` never sees, so it logs itself.
 */

 * would leave the lane claiming a different owner depending on which path you
