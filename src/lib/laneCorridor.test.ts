/**
 * The corridors, and the one thing THEY must never read.
 *
 * A lane used to get arrow headroom because of what it was called: three
 * names — a tutor, a teacher, a discovery rail — were written into the layout
 * module, and any other lane's spanning or backward arrow drew straight over
 * its own cells. The rule is the whole rule, stated on the data: which lane a
 * cell sits in, and which column its step occupies. Every case is therefore
 * posed on lanes named nothing in particular, because a name is not an input.
 *
 * One table, because there is one rule. The single board and the compare
 * each had a copy of it once, and the compare's resolved a canonical lane
 * into each variant while the board's matched by id — the compared-variant
 * case is the one the board's copy would have failed, and the pricing case
 * is what holds the two layouts to one row track now that there is one.
