/**
 * A SKILL NAMED AND NOT RUN LEAVES A ROW.
 *
 * The notice in the composer closed half of the grievance it was built for:
 * a reader who typed `/audit` and chose to send their sentence as prose was
 * told on screen that nothing ran, and the model was told in the prompt — but
 * the transcript kept no record. Scrolled back an hour later, or read by an
 * agent walking the session, the decision was gone: the only trace of it was
 * a token in a sentence, which is exactly the thing that reads as an
 * invocation.
 *
 * So the cases here are about the RECORD rather than the notice. What a send
 * leaves behind when the offer is declined, what it leaves behind when the
 * offer is taken (nothing — the invocation is its own evidence), and whether
 * what it left behind is still there after the tab has forgotten everything
 * it knew.
 *
 * The reload case is the one that needs care, and it is the reason this file
 * takes a client at all. Asserting on `useAgentRun` after a send proves the
 * row is in module memory and nothing else — the same pass a row written
 * nowhere would give. This one writes through a fake `agent_messages`,
 * forgets the run and its hydrate mark (`forgetAgentRun`, which is the seam
 * that exists for this), and reads the row back out of the table. If the
 * write never happened the table is empty and the transcript comes back
 * empty with it.
