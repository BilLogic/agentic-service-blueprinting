/**
 * The loop, from a fake provider through a tool to its result and back.
 *
 * Provider → tool → result → provider is the iteration the product is, and
 * it had no test: the tools were tested through `run`, the roster through
 * its derivation, the providers not at all, and the loop that threads them
 * only by hand. This drives `sendToAgent` with a scripted provider adapter
 * — no network, no key beyond the string that unlocks the send — and
 * asserts what a person and the model each see: the transcript's rows, and
 * the `tool_result` parts fed back on the next round.
 *
 * Four calls, the ones the loop has to get right: a read that runs (the
 * sample's `list_blueprint`), a write that runs (`create_phase`, on the
 * service the session was handed), and two writes the session cannot run —
 * one the no-database trial has no tool for, one the deployment's allowlist
 * disabled — each refused in the loop's words, not dispatched, and the
 * model told what it can do instead.
