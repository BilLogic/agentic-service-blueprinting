/**
 * The sentences the loop answers a tool call with when it will not run it,
 * the status row it shows when the batch limit bites, and the one limit
 * both quote. Next to the tool definitions because they are the tool
 * layer's other answers: what a call gets back when no definition runs.
 *
 * Each refusal says the second thing only — that the tool does not exist in
 * THIS session, or what to do instead — never the first: a model has no
 * business learning why a deployment narrowed its roster or which provider
 * key a person holds.
 *
 * WHY SOME OF THESE ARE ONE MODULE, AND THE RULE FOR WHICH.
 *
 * A refusal is the prompt an eval case grades a recovery from. Reworded on
 * one side only, the Node eval harness goes on grading a run against words
 * no session says — and it passes while doing it, because the sentence it
 * judges against is its own. So a refusal that BOTH readers' gates can say
 * lives here once and crosses to the harness through its surface entry
 * (`scripts/agent-harness/app-surface.entry.ts`), where it is pinned.
 *
 * THE TEST FOR SHARING, one rule for every sentence below: share it when the
 * harness has a gate of its own whose answer is this same statement, and the
 * statement is TRUE of the harness's session. Otherwise it is APP-ONLY, and
 * says at its definition which half fails — no gate on the far side, or a
 * gate whose session this sentence would lie about. Two things are NOT the
 * test: whether a model could reach the refusal (a model can call any name on
 * the roster, so every refusal is reachable), and what today's cases happen to
 * call (a suite grows). A sentence exported with no gate to say it is a seam
 * no test can guard, because there is no copy to watch for.
