/**
 * ONE ANSWER PER TOOL CALL: run it, or refuse it with this sentence.
 *
 * The seam between what a session was OFFERED and what one of its calls is
 * ADMITTED to do. The loop used to ask that question in eight near-identical
 * blocks, five of which re-stated conditions `roster.ts` had already applied
 * to build the offer — so the two could disagree about a fact either of them
 * could have derived, and did: a call tripping two conditions read back
 * whichever sentence the cascade reached first, which made the order of the
 * blocks part of the contract with nothing but a prose note holding it.
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS AN INPUT, because the split is the whole point.
 * The declarable half is `toolStanding` — the deployment's allow-list, the
 * search offer, the two availability fields, and the write gate's PLACE in
 * the order. This module adds the sentences, and nothing else: it holds no
 * condition the offer does not hold. The live half arrives as `facts`, four
 * things no description of a tool can carry, each named at its field below.
 *
 * WHY THE SENTENCES LIVE HERE rather than on the grounds themselves:
 * `roster.ts` decides membership and must stay sayable without a refusal
 * vocabulary, and `refusals.ts` owns the words. This is the one mapping from
 * a ground to its sentence, so a reworded refusal moves in one file and both
 * readers of the roster follow.
