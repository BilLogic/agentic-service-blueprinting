/**
 * A Tool is one module: what it is called, which surface it belongs to, the
 * arguments it takes, where it may run, and what it does. Everything a
 * session derives from a tool — the schema the model receives, the roster it
 * is offered on, the dispatch that runs it — reads this one definition, so
 * a tool is added by writing one and nowhere else.
 *
 * The arguments are a zod schema, and that is the whole reason this shape
 * exists. Before it, the schema a model was shown and the keys a handler
 * read were two string lists in two files that no compiler compared, held
 * together by a script that read both by regex. Here `run` receives the
 * inferred type, a key the schema does not declare is a type error in the
 * handler, and a call that does not fit the schema is refused at the seam
 * with a message that names the argument — instead of an `undefined` that
 * travels on into a write.
