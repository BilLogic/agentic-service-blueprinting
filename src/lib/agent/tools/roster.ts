/**
 * One session's standing on one tool — and THE one place the gates'
 * membership, and the order they answer in, are written down.
 *
 * Two readers walk this: `sessionRoster` below walks every definition
 * through it to build the offer, and the loop's admission answer walks one
 * call through it to decide whether that call may run. They used to spell
 * the same five conditions separately, in different orders, agreeing only by
 * a prose note asking the next editor to keep them in step. The failure that
 * bought was not a tool running when it should not — both readers refused
 * the same set — it was the WORDS: a `search_blueprint` call on a
 * no-database trial trips the search gate and the trial gate at once, and
 * the call read back the trial's sentence while the roster had withheld the
 * tool for the search plan. Whichever reader was written first won, which
 * made the order of eight near-identical blocks load-bearing and invisible.
 *
 * THE GATES ARE APPLIED IN SEQUENCE, each on top of the last, rather than
 * one mode gate returning for all of them. The earlier shape leaned on a
 * subsumption — a tool the trial may run is a read or a navigation, so it is
 * one mobile may run, so it is not a write — which holds in the definitions
 * today and is nothing a reader of this function can see. Applying each gate
 * costs a comparison and stops the offer from depending on a claim about a
 * list somewhere else. It also makes the offer strictly narrower in
 * principle: a tool BOTH trial-or-mobile-available AND a write would now
 * reach the write gate instead of being offered by the mode gate above it.
 * That is a no-op only because `defineWriteTool` fixes every write's
 * availability to neither, which `definition.test.ts` pins for this reason.
 *
 * WHAT IS SINGLE-SOURCED HERE, and what is not. Both readers now ask ONE
 * function, so which sentence a call tripping two conditions reads back is a
 * function of this description rather than of which cascade was written
 * first. The order itself is still CODE — five sequential `if`s — so WHERE a
 * new gate goes is an edit a reader makes here, with the others in front of
 * them, and no data list will make that choice for them. The claim is that
 * the order has one home, not that it stopped mattering.
 *
 * `isWrite` is an ARGUMENT rather than a field read off the definition, and
 * it is the one input the two readers do not share. The offer asks the
 * definition (`surface === 'write'`), because a list of tools is all an offer
 * has. The admission asks its own predicate, because `ui_command` is a write
 * exactly when its `command` argument names a mutating one, and no roster can
 * hold an argument. Same gate, same place in the order, two inputs.
 *
 * The definition is RESOLVED HERE from the name, rather than handed in beside
 * it: a name and a definition are two views of one thing, and the two callers
 * reached them from different places — one walking the definition list, one
 * holding a name a model emitted — so a mismatched pair would have split the
 * gates silently, availability read off one tool and the allow-list asked
 * about another.
 *
 * A NAME NO DEFINITION DECLARES — invented, or remembered from another
 * deployment — resolves to nothing, and that is not a ground of its own. With
 * no allow-list narrowing the session it passes the first gate, and the mode
 * gates only fire on a trial or a phone, where a tool with no availability to
 * show is withheld. So on a desktop session such a name is ADMITTED here and
 * answered by the dispatcher, which is the reader that knows a name resolving
 * to nothing and has a sentence for it.
