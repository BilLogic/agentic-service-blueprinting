 * rehearsal is the sentence the tool says — not one the harness composed in
 * the tool's name and had to keep in step by hand.
 *
 * Application-side for the same reason `testContext.ts` is: the rehearsal's
 * whole point is that it runs the app's own `run`, so the seam belongs beside
 * the definitions rather than in a script that would import across the wall.
 * Nothing in the app imports it — the harness does, through the surface
 * entry, and a test of this file holds every write tool to it.
 *
 * The client answers by the operations it was chained, never by the tool that
 * chained them: a policy a new write tool falls under without being named
 * here is the only kind that cannot go stale.

 * (`upsert_cell`, `set_cell_dependency`) return an upsert's report and their

 * (`authoringRpc.ts`, `CellWrite` / `CellDependencyWrite`); a third shape
 * (`sync_cell_touchpoints`) reads one array field and guards it with

 * So the answer is an object carrying those fields, with `toString` giving
 * the placeholder — the object IS the report, and its string form is the id
 * the report is about. Keyed by nothing: no RPC name and no tool name appears
 * here, because a table of those is exactly the hand-kept thing this module
 * exists to abolish. `inserted` is true because a rehearsal creates and never

   * A write that patches reads the row first and carries the fields it was

   * that write an `undefined` where it expects a value: `update_stakeholder`
   * trims the name it read back, `update_cell` refuses a cell whose content
   * came back empty, and `update_cell` maps over the value props beside it.
   * The KIND of value each column holds is a thing the tool already declares
   * — it declares it for the argument of the same name — so that is what is
   * read here, unwrapped through the wrappers that do not change the kind:
   *
   *   array → `[]`   number → `0`   boolean → `false`
   *   string → A PLACEHOLDER, which is a string
   *   no such argument → whatever the CALL sent under that name, else `null`
   *
   * Two of those deserve their reason said out loud.
   *
   * A text column answers with `dry-N` rather than `''` because the value it
   * stands in for is a row's EXISTING text, which a rehearsal does not know
   * and which is not empty: answering `''` makes `update_cell` reject the
   * cell it was about to edit ("a cell needs text"), which is a refusal about
   * the rehearsal wearing the tool's voice.
   *
   * And the call's own value is the FALLBACK, not the first answer. Answering
   * a before-read with what the call is about to write asserts that the write
   * already happened: `update_cell` compares the row it read against the
   * fields it was asked to set, finds them equal, and reports "Nothing
   * changed" — the one sentence a rehearsal must never put in a tool's mouth.
