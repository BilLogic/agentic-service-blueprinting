/**
 * The translation table, and the class of bug that emptied one row of it.
 *
 * `lanes_path_row_unique` sat in `TRANSLATIONS` for months explaining a lane
 * collision no constraint could raise: nothing has ever carried that name, the
 * object on those two columns was `lanes_path_row_idx`, a plain non-unique
 * index, and the branch was dead the day it was written. A matcher on a name
 * that does not exist fails silently — the author gets the fallback, or the
 * generic duplicate line, and nobody learns that a translation went missing.
 *
 * So two halves. The first drives real database text through
 * `toAuthoringError`, in the shape Postgres actually emits, because a test that
 * invents the error text can agree with a matcher that is wrong about it. The
 * second reads the module as source and holds every identifier-shaped matcher
 * against `supabase/generated/portable-core.schema.sql` — the dump of what the
 * migration series builds, carrying only the names it ends up holding. That is
 * precisely the check the dead entry would have failed.
