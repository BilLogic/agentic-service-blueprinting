/**
 * A real database behind the same calls — standalone PostgREST over the CI
 * Postgres, reached through `supabase-js` the way the browser reaches a
 * project, as the role a signed-in author is.
 *
 * `scripts/run-slice-over-postgrest.mjs` builds the stack, starts PostgREST
 * with a secret it generates, mints the service claim with that secret and
 * runs a slice with these two variables set. A slice that finds them uses
 * this instead of the in-memory table; a slice that does not runs its fast
 * form. Nothing else reads them.
 *
 * The bearer token is the whole of the identity: PostgREST verifies it with
 * the secret it was started with and switches to the `role` claim inside it,
 * and the recipe's restrictive policies read `app_metadata.role` off it
 * through `auth.jwt()`. The `apikey` header supabase-js insists on is set to
 * the same token; PostgREST ignores it.
