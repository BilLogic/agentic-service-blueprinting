/**
 * THE COMPOSER'S SKILL LOOKUP, on screen.
 *
 * The rule itself — which slashes open a lookup, and which are text — is a
 * table in `src/lib/agent/skills.test.ts`, where it belongs: it is a pure
 * function over the draft. What cannot be asserted there is what the panel
 * does with it, and that is the half a reader meets: whether the menu opens
 * on a token typed mid-sentence, and whether picking from it keeps the
 * sentence the token was sitting in.
 *
 * The panel is the real `AgentPanel` over the real sessions store. What is
 * faked is the Supabase provider (a signed-in author, no trial) and the
 * viewport probe, the same two seams the agent-session slice fakes and for
 * the same reasons. Nothing here sends, so there is no provider adapter and
 * no database.
