/**
 * What the cell panel draws above its tabs.
 *
 * `BlueprintCellDetailPanel` is the largest surface in the panel cluster and
 * it had no rendering test at all — neither here nor in the deployment built
 * on this template, which is how three of the rules below were changed by
 * separate tickets without any of them being checkable by a reader.
 *
 * It pins the rules those tickets turn on, and nothing else about the panel's
 * appearance. A test that asserted the layout wholesale would fail on every
 * ordinary edit and teach the next author to delete it.
 *
 *   - **A picture is a logo when it IS the touchpoint's registry icon.** The
 *     `-logo.` / `/logo/` filename convention the stock assets follow is the
 *     fallback, for a logo carried as a placement attachment; the row's own
 *     `icon_url` is the rule. No touchpoint gets a size because of its NAME.
 *   - **No url is elected "the design".** A cell carrying a figma.com
 *     resource gets no hover overlay and no vendor-named link. That
 *     affordance was a regex in a renderer deciding one deployment's tool
 *     policy for every deployment; `featuredPresentation` answers the same
 *     question from a flag a person sets.
 *   - **A real placement names itself even off a touchpoint lane.** The field
 *     used to appear only where the lane draws touchpoints, so a document or
 *     a recording attached to a support row had its summary rendered while
 *     the name it belonged to was suppressed — and the role a person could
 *     set on it had no reader anywhere.
 *   - **A new cell's lane badge is the lane badge.** The draft branch drew
 *     its own span and painted it with `backgroundColor: style.lane`, which
 *     is a role key ("actor"), not a colour. The browser dropped the
 *     declaration and the row a new cell was being written into rendered
 *     untinted, where every saved cell's panel names its row in that row's
 *     own colour.
 *
 * The panel's children are stubbed. Each of them reads the database through
 * its own hooks and each has, or deserves, its own test; standing them all up
 * here would mean mocking most of the app to assert two `<img>` elements.
