            The TERM, in the case the thing it names is written in everywhere
            else.

            Not the shared `Eyebrow`. An eyebrow labels a REGION of chrome —
            a menu group, a comparison column — where the label is furniture
            and the content beside it is the subject. Here the word IS the
            subject: the reader hovered a badge that says `Frontstage` and the
            card's job is to answer for that word. Setting it in caps with
            letterspacing printed a third spelling of a term the badge, the
            panel and the board all write in sentence case, so the card read
            as a different vocabulary from the one it was explaining.

            Weight separates the term from its sentence, not ink — 500, the
            one emphasis the weight doctrine gives a label. Both are
            `text-foreground`: a muted term would sit quieter than the prose
            underneath it, which is backwards for the thing being defined.

/**
 * The card, hung off the thing it defines.
 *
 * A POPOVER and never a `Tooltip`, and that is a bug fix rather than a
 * preference. Base UI's `Tooltip` is `mouseOnly` with no press to fall back
 * on, so a definition put there is invisible on a phone — and this app has a
 * real phone posture (a full-width bottom sheet). `Popover` takes `openOnHover`
 * for the pointer and keeps its own press for everyone else: one mechanism
 * reaching both readers.
 *
 * The trigger supplies `tabIndex`, so every definition is reachable by
 * keyboard focus. That is what makes the ⓘ removable: the icon was never what
 * made a definition reachable.
 *
 * Uncontrolled and hover-driven by default, which is every caller but the grid
 * headers. Those own the hover themselves — the definition surfaces from a
 * hover ANYWHERE on the header block, not just over the trigger — so they drive
 * `open` and point the card at the block through `anchor` while turning the
 * trigger's own hover off. The touch ⓘ stays the trigger, so a tap and a
 * keyboard press still open the card the ordinary way.
