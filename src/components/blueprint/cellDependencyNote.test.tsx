/**
 * The dependency editor writes the column the dependency row reads.
 *
 * It did not. The editor offered one prose field labelled "Name (optional)"
 * and the agent's dependency tool offered one argument called `label`, and
 * both landed in `cell_dependencies.name` — the badge, the word on the arrow.
 * The row draws `cell_dependencies.note`. So an author who typed the sentence
 * the row exists to show put it somewhere nothing reads, was told the
 * connection had been made, and was right about that: the edge was saved and
 * the sentence was not shown.
 *
 * A deployment measured the cost from the data side. Of 434 dependency rows, 8
 * carried a name and none carried a note, and all 8 of the names were
 * sentences about why the edge exists. Authors were not misusing a badge
 * field; it was the only field they were offered.
 *
 * Both halves are pinned here — the editor and the agent tool — because they
 * are two write surfaces onto one column and either could be moved back
 * alone.
