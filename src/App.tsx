/**
 * The app root. Standalone it takes no props and runs on the template
 * defaults; mounted by an external deployment it takes a `DeploymentConfig`
 * that skins the tree from the outermost level down. Both the named export
 * (for a host) and the default export (for `main.tsx`) resolve to this.
 *
 * ── THE ORDER OF THE TREE, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Written down because it was not obvious, and because two installations had
 * quietly settled on two different orders. Almost none of these providers
 * consume one another — every one of them reads React context from outside
 * this file or from nothing at all — so the tree has very few FORCED edges
 * and a great many arbitrary ones, which is exactly the condition under which
 * an order drifts and nobody notices.
 *
 * The forced edges, all of them:
 *
 *   - `QueryClientProvider` and `SupabaseProvider` above the three reading
 *     providers (active service, entity examples, touchpoint registry).
 *     `useSupabaseQuery` reads both; without either it has no client and no
 *     cache.
 *   - `PathSelectionProvider` above `ScenarioPathSelectionReset`, which throws
 *     outside it, and `EditorProvider` above it too — that read is null-safe,
 *     so out of place it would not throw, it would simply never fire.
 *   - `EditorErrorBoundary` in its `app` scope ABOVE everything, the
 *     deployment seam included. Its class comment carries why.
 *   - The editor's `EditorErrorBoundary` NOT above `WriteFailureNotices`. See
 *     its comment below; this is the one edge in the tree that is a behaviour
 *     rather than a wiring requirement. The app-scoped boundary is above both,
 *     which is not the same edge: a write notice has nothing left to sit
 *     beside once the tree it reported on has gone.
 *
 * Everything else is settled by band, outermost to innermost:
 *
 *   0. THE BOUNDARY, outside the bands because it is about all of them.
 *   1. The DEPLOYMENT SEAM. `DeploymentConfigProvider` is the outermost
 *      provider because every band below may be skinned by it and none of it may be skinned
 *      half way down.
 *   2. INFRASTRUCTURE — the query cache and the database client. Nothing here
 *      renders anything the reader sees. The theme used to be a third
 *      provider in this band and is now a module-scope effect instead, which
 *      is a band above all of these rather than a peer of them: it has
 *      finished before the first of them is constructed.
 *   3. SHARED READS — the active service, then the two session-wide reads
 *      that hang off it. One query each, cached and shared by everything
 *      below, which is the whole reason they are providers rather than hooks
 *      at the call sites.
 *   4. INTERACTION STATE — the editor, the view state, the path selection.
 *      What the reader is looking at and what they have chosen.
 *   5. PRESENTATION — the tooltip delay, then the boundary and the shell.
 *
 * The rule that decides the arbitrary edges is that a band may read the bands
 * outside it and never the ones inside. Read top to bottom, the tree goes from
 * what is true of the whole installation to what is true of this moment on
 * this screen. When something new needs a home, place it in its band; if it
 * belongs to two, it is doing two things.
